Some examples for generating SQL execution plans.

The scripts are designed to work in SQL Plus or SQLCL.

Spool files (.lst) are included so you can see the expected results.

To run the examples yourself, use a DBA account and start by running "ctables.sql". Note that this will drop some tables - so use a test database only!

Next, run the examples: eg1.sql ... eg6.sql

I have included an interactive report saved from Enterprise Manager: EM_sqlmonitor_output.html
