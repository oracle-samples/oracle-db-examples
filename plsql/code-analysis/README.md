As a database programming language, PL/SQL code is stored in the Oracle Database. That means that we can analyze our code using data dictionary views, most importantly the ALL_IDENTIFIERS and ALL_STATEMENTS views, which are populated by PL/Scope.

This folder offers a set of stand-alone queries and procedures that demonstrate PL/Scope and give you a quick and easy way to get started with this fantastic utility.

Philipp Salvisberg has also put together a very nice utility full of packages and views that can take you a long way towards fully leverage PL/Scope. Check it out here:  https://github.com/PhilippSalvisberg/plscope-utils
