# Oracle Machine Learning sample Notebooks in R language
The sample notebooks on this folder are expected to be used with Oracle Machine Learning for R and Oracle Machine Learning for Spark. 

The notebooks available in JSON format are compatible with any open-source Apache Zeppelin notebook environment.

That includes an Apache Zeppelin running on a server that can connect to an Oracle Database (for using the OML4R notebook examples), or an Apache Zeppelin running on a server (Hadoop Edge Node) that can connect to a Hadoop Cluster.

The OML4R notebooks can be used with an on-premise Oracle Database and also a Database Cloud Service (except the Autonomous Database, which runs its own Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks).

The OML4Spark notebooks can also be used with the Oracle Big Data Manager (available in the Oracle Big Data Appliance or Oracle Big Data Cloud Service).
