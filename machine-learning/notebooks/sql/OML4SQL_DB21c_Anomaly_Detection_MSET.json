It calibrates expected behavior from available, historical data of the normal operational sequence of monitored signals. It incorporates the learned behavior of the system into a persistent MSET-SPRT model. You can apply the model to new records to detect anomalous behavior.\n\nMSET is a nonlinear, nonparametric anomaly detection machine learning technique that calibrates the expected behavior of a system based on historical data from the normal operational sequence of monitored signals. It incorporates the learned behavior of a system into a persistent model that represents the normal estimated behavior. You can deploy the model to evaluate a subsequent stream of live signal vectors using OML4SQL scoring functions. To form a hypothesis as to the overall health of the system, these functions calculate the difference between the estimated and the actual signal values (residuals) and use SPRT calculations to determine whether any of the signals have become degraded.\n\nTo build a good model, MSET requires sufficient historical data that adequately captures all normal modes of behavior of the system. Incomplete data results in false alerts when the system enters a mode of operation that was poorly represented in the historical data. MSET assumes that the characteristics of the data being monitored do not change over time. Once deployed, MSET is a stationary model and does not evolve as it monitors a data stream.\n\nBoth MSET and SPRT operate on continuous time-ordered sensor data. If the raw data stream needs to be pre-processed or sampled, you must do that before you pass the data to the MSET-SPRT model.\n\nThe ALGO_MSET_SPRT algorithm is designated as a classification machine learning function. It generates a model in which each data row is labeled as either normal or anomalous. For anomalous predictions, the prediction details provide a list of the sensors that show the anomaly and a weight.\n\nWhen creating an MSET-SPRT model with the DBMS_DATA_MINING.CREATE_MODEL function, use the case_id argument to provide a unique row identifier for the time-ordered data that the algorithm requires. The build is then able to sort the training data and create windows for sampling and variance estimation. If you do not provide a case_id, then an exception occurs.\n\nMSET-SPRT supports only numeric data. An exception occurs if other column types are in the build data.\n\nWhen the number of sensors is very high, MSET-SPRT leverages random projections to improve the scalability and robustness of the algorithm. Random projections is a technique that reduces dimensionality while preserving pairwise distances. By randomly projecting the sensor data, the problem is solved in a distance-preserving, lower-dimension space. The MSET hypothesis testing approach is applied on the projected data where each random projection can be viewed as a Monte Carlo simulation of system health. The overall probability of an anomaly follows a binomial distribution with the number of projections as the number of trials and the number of alerting projections as the number of successes.\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 Oracle Corporation                             \n###### [The Universal Permissive License (UPL), Version 1.0](https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl/)\n---","user":"OMLUSER","dateUpdated":"2021-08-23T20:00:28+0000","config":{"colWidth":12,"graph":{"mode":"table","height":300,"optionOpen":false,"keys":[],"values":[],"groups":[],"scatter":{}},"enabled":true,"editorMode":"ace/mode/markdown","fontSize":9,"results":{},"editorSetting":{"language":"md","editOnDblClick":false},"editorHide":true,"title":false},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"results":{"code":"SUCCESS","msg":[{"type":"HTML","data":"<h1>Oracle Machine Learning MSET-SPRT Algorithm</h1>\n<h3>The Multivariate State Estimation Technique-Sequential Probability Ratio Test (MSET-SPRT) algorithm is a nonlinear, nonparametric anomaly detection technique for monitoring critical processes.</h3>\n<p>The DBMS_DATA_MINING.ALGO_MSET_SPRT algorithm detects subtle anomalies while producing minimal false alarms.
