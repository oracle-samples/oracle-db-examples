It can be used to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other, and is most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow a Normal distribution if the value of a scaling term in the test statistic were known. When the scaling term is unknown and is replaced by an estimate based on the data, the test statistic (under certain conditions) follows a Student's t distribution.\nFor more details on the background of t-tests , see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test\" onclick=\"return ! window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test');\"> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test<\/a> <\/a><\/p>\n<p><code>Hint<\/code>: P_Values &lt; 0.05 show statistically significantly differences (over 95% confidence) in the amounts purchased by men vs. women\n<code>Hint<\/code>: NaN is used for display when there are nulls and/or empty<\/p>\n","type":"HTML"}],"taskStatus":"SUCCESS","forms":"[]","status":"SUCCESS"},"sizeX":0,"hideCode":true,"width":12,"hideResult":false,"dynamicFormParams":null,"row":0,"hasTitle":false,"hideVizConfig":true,"hideGutter":true,"relations":[],"forms":"[]"},{"col":0,"visualizationConfig":null,"hideInIFrame":false,"selectedVisualization":"table","title":"Compare average amount SOLD_TO_MEN versus average amount SOLD_TO_WOMEN grouped by INCOME_LEVEL -

To calculate the coefficient, the number of concordant and discordant pairs is computed. A pair of observations is concordant if the observation with the larger x also has a larger value of y. A pair of observations is discordant if the observation with the larger x has a smaller y.\nThe Kendall's tau-b also provides a significance indicator like the p-value. If p-value is small (&lt; 0.05), then it means that there are significant corrleation between the two groups.\nFor more details and background on Kendall's tau-b correlation, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient\" onclick=\"return ! window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient');\"> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient<\/a> <\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the following example, we compute Kendall's tau-b  coefficient between the income level and the amount sold to men and women.
