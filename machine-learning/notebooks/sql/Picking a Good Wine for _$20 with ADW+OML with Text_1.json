There's a hint of green stalks and leaves detectable on the palate amidst underripe black cherry and plum flavors, but bright acidity gives this wine a fresh character and the spiced plum finish is pleasant.\tFirst Harvest\t86\t18\tNew York\tNorth Fork of Long Island\tLong Island\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tComtesse Thérèse 2005 First Harvest Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)\tMerlot\tComtesse Thérèse\n47773\tUS\tWonderfully rich with lush dark chocolate and espresso notes, this is another lovely, highly drinkable Merlot from Comtesse Thérèse. There's a good amount of charred oak, but it's integrated seamlessly with concentrated black plum and berry flavors. The finish is long, and accented by pleasant astringency of walnut skins and tobacco.\tTraditional\t87\t18\tNew York\tNorth Fork of Long Island\tLong Island\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tComtesse Thérèse 2005 Traditional Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)\tMerlot\tComtesse Thérèse\n23556\tUS\tAged 14 months in Russian Oak, this is a different kind of Chard with notes of chamomile, fresh mint sprigs, vanilla and cigar tobacco among the more typical melon fruits and lime citrus. Medium-full but a bit flat in the mouth with a solid but quite smoky finish.\tRussian Oak\t84\t20\tNew York\tNorth Fork of Long Island\tLong Island\tLauren Buzzeo\t@laurbuzz\tComtesse Thérèse 2007 Russian Oak Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island)\tChardonnay\tComtesse Thérèse\n55226\tUS\tYoung and bony, with primary fruit flavors of blackberries, cherries, briary tobacco and cedar. With its dry finish and rich tannins, it's a candidate for limited cellaring.

Mother Vine Reserve is a smallish offering for Concannon, loaded with black olive, tea and black pepper. It's Cab Franc-esque in some way, yet intensely dark, brooding and velvety.\tMother Vine Reserve\t88\t35\tCalifornia\tLivermore Valley\tCentral Coast\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tConcannon 2008 Mother Vine Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tConcannon\n40768\tUS\tVegetal, with an asparagus edge to the citrus fruit flavors.

Either way, this dry, silky Pinot Noir is rustic, but it does show real varietal character.\tReserve\t86\t30\tCalifornia\tSanta Lucia Highlands\tCentral Coast\t\t\tConcannon 2009 Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)\tPinot Noir\tConcannon\n10447\tUS\tA ripe Chardonnay, big and full, with fistfuls of oak influence and a spoonful of sugar to help it go down.

Striking the right balance between fleshy and firm, it'll go well with just about anything.\tReserve\t89\t25\tCalifornia\tLivermore Valley\tCentral Coast\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tConcannon 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)\tChardonnay\tConcannon\n16388\tUS\tA compelling spicy aroma and richly layered fruit give a lot of appeal to this full-bodied, fully tannic and nicely sculpted wine. It has a deep dark color, captivating oak and white-pepper aromas and a rich generous mouthfeel accompanied by an appropriately high level of fine-grained tannin. Best after 2020.\tNina's Cuvée\t92\t38\tCalifornia\tLivermore Valley\tCentral Coast\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tConcannon 2014 Nina's Cuvée Petite Sirah (Livermore Valley)\tPetite Sirah\tConcannon\n90695\tUS\tThis very appealing wine smells like a Danish pastry but then turns nicely dry on the palate, gushing with crisp apple, ripe Bosc pear and toasted-baguette flavors. Made from Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc grapes, it's medium bodied, complex and well balanced.\tReserve Assemblage Blanc\t90\t26\tCalifornia\tLivermore Valley\tCentral Coast\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tConcannon 2015 Reserve Assemblage Blanc White (Livermore Valley)\tWhite Blend\tConcannon\n39235\tUS\tVery oaky, very buttery, very posh in texture, this wine takes the spicy richness of oak-barrel fermentation and aging to a high level. It's not at all shy about the toast, caramel and baking-spice flavors, with a mouthcoating texture that helps those accents linger on the finish.\tReserve\t89\t30\tCalifornia\tLivermore Valley\tCentral Coast\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tConcannon 2015 Reserve Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)\tChardonnay\tConcannon\n127882\tUS\tThis wine is smooth and refreshing, showing fresh raspberry and strawberry flavors and a texture that's mouthfilling but nicely crisp. It's quite fruity and light, especially considering the bold grape variety from which it is made.\tRosé of\t87\t24\tCalifornia\tLivermore Valley\tCentral Coast\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tConcannon 2016 Rosé of Petite Sirah (Livermore Valley)\tPetite Sirah\tConcannon\n53207\tPortugal\tThis smooth, rounded wine has touches of wood aging, along with a herbaceous character just now beginning to soften and fill out.

The two are joined easily by the wood-aging flavors that give a smoky character as well as toastiness. The citrus and crisp peach skin acidity leave a lively aftertaste. Drink from 2016.\tConceito\t91\t40\tDouro\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tConceito Vinhos 2012 Conceito White (Douro)\tPortuguese White\tConceito Vinhos\n63588\tPortugal\tThis wine is made from the Bastardo grape which, as its name suggests, is tough to handle and rarely found.

Its perfumed fruits bring in apple, green plum and great acidity that is balanced by the judicious wood aging. This is a rich wine, full of intense acidity and fruitiness that needs to age further.

Aromas of orange blossom, lime and other green fruits are good, while flavors of citrus, grapefruit and cucumber are fresh and appealing. A good but standard wine that is lifted by a touch of green herb and brine.\tTrio Reserva\t86\t14\tCasablanca Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConcha y Toro 2008 Trio Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tConcha y Toro\n120726\tChile\tWith savory aromas of soy sauce and beef broth, this is not only fruity smelling, it's meaty on the nose. The palate is full and voluminous, but not thick. Flavors of boysenberry and blackberry are slightly leafy and green, while the finish shows a good texture and grabby tannins.\tCasillero del Diablo Reserva\t87\t11\tRapel Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConcha y Toro 2011 Casillero del Diablo Reserva Malbec (Rapel Valley)\tMalbec\tConcha y Toro\n95647\tChile\tWild berry aromas come with a cool hint of herbal mint. This is full, grabby and solid in the mouth. Flavors of dark fruits come across lightly stewed and pruny, while the finish dishes up a final taste of prune and foresty notes.\tCasillero del Diablo Reserva\t86\t11\tCentral Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConcha y Toro 2012 Casillero del Diablo Reserva Merlot (Central Valley)\tMerlot\tConcha y Toro\n32091\tChile\tA mix of tropical and citrus aromas is balanced by classic Leyda scents of bell pepper and jalapeño. This is crystal clear and zesty on the tongue, with cutting acidity. Lemon, tangerine and briny notes create a citrusy flavor profile, while the finish is juicy, crisp and cleansing.\tMarques de Casa Concha\t89\t22\tLeyda Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConcha y Toro 2014 Marques de Casa Concha Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tConcha y Toro\n96534\tPortugal\tWarm, soft and fruity, this has notes of spices, soft tannins and a light touch of acidity.

The palate comes across kind of hard, tight and candied, with sweet berry fruit flavors that turn bitter on the finish.\t\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConde de Altava 2012  Rioja\tTempranillo\tConde de Altava\n45161\tSpain\tWarm, baked aromas smell of clay and raisin, and later a wave of minty green enters the picture. The palate is sort of lean, with some holes in the fabric, while flavors of wild berry and black fruits fold in a heavier note of molasses. Limited in its virtues; short in complexity.\t\t85\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConde de San Cristóbal 2006  Ribera del Duero\tTinta Fina\tConde de San Cristóbal\n107205\tSpain\tUnusual but not unpleasant aromas of cinnamon and coffee cake lead to a saturated palate with rugged tannins. Flavors of fig paste, chocolate and baking spices confirm the wine's ripeness, while blackened flavors and rock-hard tannins drive the finish.\tReserva\t89\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConde de Siruela 2012 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tConde de Siruela\n118108\tSpain\tThis wine's classic Albariño aromas of white flowers and stone fruit are simple and nice.

It's very much in the modern Napa style, soft, rich and sophisticated, with cherry, red currant, Asian spice and new oak flavors. It's an elegant wine, but a fairly tannic one, with a dusty astringency that suggests mid-term aging. An auspicious, if expensive, new beginning.\tProprietary Red Wine\t92\t130\tCalifornia\tOakville\tNapa\t\t\tContinuum 2005 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Oakville)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tContinuum\n97637\tItaly\tTruffle, new leather, ripe plum, tilled soil and chopped herb are some of the aromas you'll find on this impressive red.

Two things keep the score down—a chalky edge to the tannins, and some noticeable volatility (a whiff of nail polish)on the nose.\tStorm Front Red\t86\t28\tWashington\tRed Mountain\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tConvergence Zone 2009 Storm Front Red Red (Red Mountain)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tConvergence Zone\n30094\tUS\tA blend of two-thirds Grenache, the rest a mix of Mourvèdre and Syrah, this demonstrates the spicy cherry appeal of the main grape.

The flavors show some redder fruit flavors—raspberries—as well as touches of caramel and rhubarb, and this slightly syrupy wine finishes with a tangy edge. It's a little eccentric in style and flavor profile, but savory and tasty in its own way—and a relative bargain.\tArtisan Wines Classic\t86\t10\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMarquee 2006 Artisan Wines Classic G-S-M (South Eastern Australia)\tG-S-M\tMarquee\n96998\tAustralia\tOpening with a mineral-lime edge, this wine announces that it's tough as nails when it's actually more of a teddy bear in the mouth.

This is so large and extracted on the palate that the tannins grind. Ripe blackberry, cassis and a hint of salt fill the flavor profile, while this finishes fat, tannic and with flavors of licorice and blackberry. Drink through 2026.\tSingle Vineyard Estate Bottled\t92\t40\tCentral Spain\tDominio de Valdepusa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Griñon 2011 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Dominio de Valdepusa)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tMarques de Griñon\n90534\tSpain\tLush ripe aromas of earthy black fruits and graphite open this varietal Graciano from a warm vintage. Hefty and chewy in feel, this tastes of fudge cake, blackberry and cassis. A lasting stout finish offers tobacco and prune flavors. Yes, this is huge.

The wine is narrow on the palate, with herbal plum flavors, while the finish is short and doesn't elevate things. Even at $9 this is regular in overall quality.\t\t84\t9\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de la Musa 2011 Garnacha (Cariñena)\tGarnacha\tMarques de la Musa\n121092\tSpain\tOpens with orange peel aromas.

The flavors are a mix of earthiness, pasty berry and red currant, while the finish is short, juicy and lightly oaked. For $10 it's a fair wine.\tVendimia Seleccionada\t85\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Almonacid 2009 Vendimia Seleccionada Tempranillo-Garnacha (Cariñena)\tTempranillo-Garnacha\tMarqués de Almonacid\n110130\tSpain\tSlightly rooty and warm, with a nose that's one part stewy and malty and another part complex and fruity. In the mouth, vanilla and spice add character to common berry fruit flavors, while the finish is silky and fairly long. Overall this is a nice, handsome wine with balance and character. Expect to be pleased but not blown away.\tReserva\t89\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Arviza 2001 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarqués de Arviza\n83403\tSpain\tOpens with rubber, smoke, leather and coffee aromas, then the fruit comes in on the palate, which is juicy and correct, with tight, fresh red-fruit flavors and notes of ripe tomato and pepper flake.

The Xinomavro gives the wine its tannic, slightly spiky edge, while Syrah rounds the character out with juicy fruit and softer spices. Overall, an assertive, ageworthy red that will pair well with grilled lamb or beef.\tKappa P62\t86\t\tMacedonia\t\t\tSusan Kostrzewa\t@suskostrzewa\tPavlou-Kagas 2005 Kappa P62 Red (Macedonia)\tRed Blend\tPavlou-Kagas\n19735\tAustralia\tThis sees less new oak than the Jones Block, so the quality of the biodynamically grown fruit shines.

It's also half the price of the vineyard designates. With raspberry, cherry and cola flavors set in a flurry of spices, it doesn't have the massive overripeness of the others. But that's exactly why it's a more appealing and food-friendly wine.\tWestside\t90\t19\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\t\t\tPeachy Canyon 2011 Westside Zinfandel (Paso Robles)\tZinfandel\tPeachy Canyon\n23197\tUS\tThis is a unique and exciting take on California's historic grape from one of the region's pioneering wineries. Aromas recall sour cranberry, orange peel, strawberry and sagebrush.

Vanilla accents lifted sour cherry and cranberry aromas, but on the palate the flavors darken and deepen, trending toward black cherries and plum. Has a nicely balanced, silky texture in the mouth, then a firm, long finish suggesting cellaring.

Just goes to show. It's dramatic in rich peach, fig, date and ripe green melon, but where does all that butterscotch and crème brûlée come from?

Intriguing aromas of fruit compote and roasted meat lead into a palate of blueberry and spice. It's medium to full in body, with supple tannins that finish on a faintly dusty note. Ready to drink now, but should hold at least through 2020.\tOrphan Bank\t93\t57\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLangmeil 2010 Orphan Bank Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tLangmeil\n126449\tAustralia\tSourced from one of the world's oldest surviving vineyards (planted in 1843), this is a full-bodied, velvety-textured rendering of Barossa Shiraz. An ample dusting of licorice and baking spices add zest to ripe blackberry and plum fruit flavors, and the wine finishes long and lush, with a flash of vanilla. Drink now–2025+.\tThe Freedom 1843\t93\t149\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLangmeil 2013 The Freedom 1843 Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tLangmeil\n90517\tAustralia\tThe 2014 vintage was slightly cooler than 2013 in the Barossa, which bodes well for Cabernet. This shows aromatic red currants, bay leaf and sage on the nose, then folds in hints of cinnamon and brown sugar. The oak is in the background, letting the fruit carry the wine, yet building in a rich, velvety texture. Drink now–2030.\tBlacksmith\t92\t31\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLangmeil 2014 Blacksmith Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tLangmeil\n73051\tUS\tThe bouquet is pretty big and dense, with some high-tone raspberry peeking through the surface. Black plum and cherry get help from licorice and vanilla on the palate. Zippy fruit is the signature, even as it does a nice, long fade.\tMeritage\t91\t50\tCalifornia\tNorth Coast\tNorth Coast\t\t\tLangtry 1997 Meritage Red (North Coast)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tLangtry\n78442\tUS\tThis Bordeaux blend is strong in oak and primary fruit flavors. It bursts in the mouth with an explosion of blackberry and cherry jam, caramel and buttered cinnamon toast. Delicious now, but a little direct and obvious. Hard to say where it's going.\tOld Soldier Road Tephra Ridge Vineyard\t89\t40\tCalifornia\tLake County\t\t\t\tLangtry 2006 Old Soldier Road Tephra Ridge Vineyard Red (Lake County)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tLangtry\n70998\tFrance\tThe top of the line in the Lannac Saint-Jean range from young vignerons Fabien Jouves and Emmanuel Rybinski. With wood aging, it shows a mineral, austere note over the stone fruit flavors. It has weight and structure, though the fruit needs time to come through the toast of the wood.\tLa Chapelle\t90\t44\tSouthwest France\tCahors\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tLannac Saint-Jean 2007 La Chapelle Malbec (Cahors)\tMalbec\tLannac Saint-Jean\n95056\tFrance\tThe great 2002 vintage has produced some remarkable wines and this falls into that category. Still so fresh, with swathes of mineral texture and tight acidity, it is still developing. Hints of toast point to a future where the wine will be rounder and with even more complexity. For now, the crisp apple, pear and softer yellow fruits dominate. Drink from 2017.\tNoble Cuvée Brut\t95\t130\tChampagne\tChampagne\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tLanson 2002 Noble Cuvée Brut  (Champagne)\tChampagne Blend\tLanson\n82842\tFrance\tThis Champagne is produced from a small parcel of Chardonnay in the heart of the city of Reims above the Lanson cellars. It has more than rarity value with its wonderful mature flavors, richness and flavors of vanilla, baked apple and hints of the wood in which the wine fermented. It is ready to drink now.\tClos Lanson Blanc de Blancs Brut\t95\t195\tChampagne\tChampagne\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tLanson 2006 Clos Lanson Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)\tChardonnay\tLanson\n89734\tFrance\tThe wine from this clos or walled vineyard in the city of Reims has spent eight years aging before disgorgement. It's a rare wine, with a wonderful balance between its toasty character and the crisp, dry apple and green-fruit flavors. It will certainly age further, so wait—if you can—until 2019.\tClos Lanson\t96\t196\tChampagne\tChampagne\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tLanson 2006 Clos Lanson Chardonnay (Champagne)\tChardonnay\tLanson\n114423\tFrance\tThe beautifully judged pale-orange-pink color of this delicious wine is a sign of the balance in the glass. It is crisp and towards the dry end of Brut, typical of the Lanson style. There is fine acidity and a crisp texture from the Chardonnay in the blend. Hints of red fruits come through along with a touch of tannin. The wine is ready to drink.\tRose Label Brut Rosé\t91\t60\tChampagne\tChampagne\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tLanson NV Rose Label Brut Rosé  (Champagne)\tChampagne Blend\tLanson\n114122\tChile\tThis is a new wine from one of Chile's most consistent producers, and it's quite the saturated bruiser. The color is deep purple, while the nose is raw and heavy, with deep fruit and plenty of bacon-like character. The mouth is like blackberry pie, while the feel is full and tannic, although not at all offensive or tough. The finish is dark, brooding and just a little bitter. An interesting new entry to Chile's roster, and one that's very well oaked.\tCuvée Alexandre\t88\t20\tRapel Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLapostolle 2001 Cuvée Alexandre Syrah (Rapel Valley)\tSyrah\tLapostolle\n60789\tChile\tThis black wine is so ripe it's syrupy. Dense aromas of blackberry, raisin, cassis liqueur and perfume push the limit, while licorice, prune, raisin, blueberry and chocolate flavors end in a sticky, slow-moving finish with a lot of weight. This tastes every bit like a warm-climate wine.\tCuvée Alexandre Apalta Vineyard\t88\t25\tColchagua Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLapostolle 2009 Cuvée Alexandre Apalta Vineyard Syrah (Colchagua Valley)\tSyrah\tLapostolle\n55214\tChile\tThis heavily charred blend of five grapes opens with maple, toast, wood and floral black-fruit aromas. The palate is full and forward but also alert and juicy. Flavors of blueberry, blackberry, licorice, chocolate and vanilla finish oaky, with a final dose of barrel-driven vanilla matching full black fruit. Drink through 2020.\tBorobo\t92\t85\tChile\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLapostolle 2011 Borobo Red (Chile)\tRed Blend\tLapostolle\n110160\tChile\tThe cool conditions that defined the 2011 vintage in Chile are draped all over this Chardonnay. The nose deals notes of applesauce and oaky cinnamon, while the palate is sleepy, with very little happening. Flavors of spicy oak rest on top of white fruit flavors, and the finish is neutral and acidic.\tCuvée Alexandre Atalayas Vineyard Made with Organic Grapes\t86\t25\tCasablanca Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLapostolle 2011 Cuvée Alexandre Atalayas Vineyard Made with Organic Grapes Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)\tChardonnay\tLapostolle\n68619\tSpain\tStalky, damp aromas are low on freshness and fruit.

A style of wine that will be better for a few more months, it should be drunk from late 2017.\tChâteau des Muraires Séduction\t91\t29\tProvence\tCôtes de Provence\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tBernard Magrez 2016 Château des Muraires Séduction Rosé (Côtes de Provence)\tRosé\tBernard Magrez\tGT_90_Points\n64254\tFrance\tAs often with Magdelaine in recent vintages, this is on the austere side. Its firm tannins and structure dominate the fruit. That said, it does have bright fruit underneath all this tightness, and is finely balanced, the berry fruits lifted with some intense acidity. It needs another few months to settle in bottle.\t\t91\t\tBordeaux\tSaint-Émilion\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tChâteau Magdelaine 2006  Saint-Émilion\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tChâteau Magdelaine\tGT_90_Points\n119624\tFrance\tThis is certainly rich, packed with youthful green- and white-fruit flavors, but it still has that seductive elegance that is the hallmark of Deutz. Here is a wine that definitely needs aging. It has richness but there is still a raw edge.\tBrut\t92\t67\tChampagne\tChampagne\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDeutz 2000 Brut  (Champagne)\tChampagne Blend\tDeutz\tGT_90_Points\n57732\tUS\tTight-grained tannin plays a supporting role to this wine's undeniable earthiness, a mix of compost and wild mushroom. Subtle on the nose, the savory character gives way eventually to a density and concentration of brighter flavors, from cherry and citrus to spiky pine.\tGap's Crown Vineyard\t91\t69\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tSojourn 2015 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)\tPinot Noir\tSojourn\tGT_90_Points\n47732\tUS\tTightly structured and quiet in oak, this wine instead exudes bright notes of lemon peel and orange blossom, offering plenty of well-traced minerality on the palate.

Dramatic now, if a bit overpowering. Calls for carefully crafted foods of the richest level, like lobster.\tDutton Ranch Dutton Palms Vineyard\t94\t48\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tDutton Estate 2007 Dutton Ranch Dutton Palms Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)\tChardonnay\tDutton Estate\tGT_90_Points\n117471\tUS\tPiquant aromas of cinnamon meet with strawberry, plum, gravel and bay leaf on the nose of this appellation blend by Steve Dooley. That bay leaf joins eucalyptus on the very clean and fresh sip, which surrounds tart raspberry, vanilla and clove flavors.\t\t91\t36\tCalifornia\tEdna Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tStephen Ross 2015 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)\tPinot Noir\tStephen Ross\tGT_90_Points\n7336\tUS\tThis is a great 2005 Pinot Noir, the best ever from Talley. The wine somehow combines huge ripe fruit with delicacy. It floods the mouth with profound currant, cherry pie, licorice, cola, raspberry, cocoa and vanilla smoke flavors, yet feels light and silky, and is thoroughly dry. That's the magic of Pinot Noir. You can enjoy this small production wine now, and it should develop additional complexities for 10 years.\tRosemary's Vineyard\t97\t70\tCalifornia\tArroyo Grande Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tTalley 2005 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)\tPinot Noir\tTalley\tGT_90_Points\n3657\tArgentina\tApartado, a high-flying Bordeaux blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, shows up only occasionally, but when it does it shines. This vintage is stunning; the black cherry and wild berry flavors are lively and honest, while the wine's structure is just where it should be. With a juicy steak or lamb chops, this wine will bowl you over.\tApartado\t92\t64\tMendoza Province\tMendoza\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFelipe Rutini 2004 Apartado Red (Mendoza)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tFelipe Rutini\tGT_90_Points\n89849\tFrance\tChalk and flint soil contribute to this tight, tangy, amazingly crisp wine. Behind this still-young texture await ripe apples, green plums and orange peel. Packed with acidity and still developing, this wine needs some more time. Drink from 2017.\tLa Chapelle des Augustins\t92\t30\tLoire Valley\tSancerre\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tHenri Bourgeois 2013 La Chapelle des Augustins  (Sancerre)\tSauvignon Blanc\tHenri Bourgeois\tGT_90_Points\n48723\tUS\tThis tastes bold in flavor and feels lavish in texture. Aromas resemble red cherry, cinnamon and nutmeg, while the flavors are ripe and spread out on the palate, seeming to form layers of fruit, spice and maple. Smooth and flavorful, it's appealing from first sniff to finish.\tParr Vineyard\t91\t32\tCalifornia\tSonoma County\tSonoma\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tMaldonado 2012 Parr Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)\tPinot Noir\tMaldonado\tGT_90_Points\n43481\tMoldova\tThis lovely wine offers aromas of cherry vanilla, ripe cherry and black raspberry.

The flavors are palate coating and dense in feel, lingering on the finish. It needs some time in the cellar to truly show its stuff. Best after 2022.\tArmada Vineyard\t93\t97\tOregon\tWalla Walla Valley (OR)\tOregon Other\tSean P.

Bright and juicy, it's packed with raspberry and blueberry fruit, balanced against lightly-applied savory highlights. Lovely mouthfeel and generous length make this a wine that's hard to put down.\tThe Conjurer\t91\t28\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tSleight of Hand 2011 The Conjurer Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tSleight of Hand\tGT_90_Points\n32471\tFrance\tSeductively rich notes of peach and yellow plum entice the nose. They also bathe the palate in a very luscious light, counteracted by fresh mousse and balancing, taut freshness. This is a lovely synthesis of rich fruit and dry restraint, fizzing away with pleasure. The finish is long, dry and lemony.\tBrut\t90\t20\tAlsace\tAlsace\t\tAnne Krebiehl MW\t@AnneInVino\tDomaine Fernand Engel NV Brut Chardonnay (Alsace)\tChardonnay\tDomaine Fernand Engel\tGT_90_Points\n8387\tFrance\tRipe and sweet, this wine is full of generous red plums and berries. It is immediately attractive with its spice, structure and tannins playing a supporting role to the almost jammy fruit. Acidity at the end adds some attractive freshness to this ripe wine. Drink from 2020\tLa Montagne\t92\t50\tBurgundy\tMarsannay\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDomaine Huguenot 2014 La Montagne  (Marsannay)\tPinot Noir\tDomaine Huguenot\tGT_90_Points\n103747\tUS\tThis wine charms with aromas of freshly sliced green apple, white peach, wet stone and flowers. It drinks off dry, with zippy acidity providing plenty of tension to keep the interest high.\tArt Den Hoed Vineyard\t90\t14\tWashington\tWashington\tWashington Other\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tCharles & Charles 2015 Art Den Hoed Vineyard Riesling (Washington)\tRiesling\tCharles & Charles\tGT_90_Points\n120253\tUS\tWinemakers Anthony Riboli and Arnaud Debons crafted this blend of 36% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Malbec, 21% Petit Verdot, 11% Petite Sirah and 4% Syrah to celebrate the winery's 100th year, with big and tasty results. Ripe blackberry, black currant, blueberry, caramel and dried herb aromas show on the nose, while dark elderberry, lavender and thyme flavors mark the palate. The package is rich and powerful, yet spicy and structured.\tCentennial Blend\t92\t85\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tSan Antonio 2014 Centennial Blend Red (Paso Robles)\tRed Blend\tSan Antonio\tGT_90_Points\n110662\tPortugal\tAs a partner to the red wine from this estate, with its Bordeaux blend, this wine brings together the Bordeaux white grapes of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon. The addition of Alvarinho rather spoils the Bordeaux moment, although for the wine it it's a plus, adding crisp taste and brightness to this rich wood-aged blend. Drink this tropical, fruity and pear-flavored wine from 2018.\tQuinta da Bacalhôa Branco\t90\t28\tPenínsula de Setúbal\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tBacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2016 Quinta da Bacalhôa Branco White (Península de Setúbal)\tPortuguese White\tBacalhôa Wines of Portugal\tGT_90_Points\n31597\tUS\tThis blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec is concentrated on the nose, with a mélange of red and black berries, red plum, fern and sweet-spice-inflected cured meat. The well-integrated palate carries similar characters supported by ample weight, firm tannins and balanced acidity. A black pepper note rings on the finish of this well-balanced, inviting wine.\t\t90\t31\tVirginia\tMonticello\t\tAlexander Peartree\t\tKing Family 2012 Meritage (Monticello)\tMeritage\tKing Family\tGT_90_Points\n31948\tUS\tAnother great success from Merryvale. Somehow they manage to make red wines that are ripe, oaky and opulent, yet maintain balance so that you can drink it over the course of a meal without the flavors palling. Dry and tannicly sophisticated, it shows complex waves of blackberries, cassis, cherries and sweet, smoky cedar.\t\t93\t65\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tMerryvale 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tMerryvale\tGT_90_Points\n33999\tUS\tLovely scents of blue and black berries open into an excellent wine from this well-known vineyard. Cherry cola and molasses flesh out the midpalate flavors, and the fruit has a brambly quality that is almost like Zinfandel. Expressive and detailed.\tFreedom Hill Vineyard\t91\t42\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tPanther Creek 2006 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)\tPinot Noir\tPanther Creek\tGT_90_Points\n104063\tUS\tRipe blueberry fruit meets vanilla, cola and thyme touches on the approachable nose of this wine from Steve Gerbac.

Shows a Chablisian style of mineral, warm stone, and citrus, but with far richer streaks, like gold embedded in flint. Oak and lees are elegantly applied. More foodworthy than most California Chards.\t\t90\t20\tCalifornia\tMonterey County\tCentral Coast\t\t\tBernardus 2001 Chardonnay (Monterey County)\tChardonnay\tBernardus\tGT_90_Points\n22114\tFrance\tMade from grapes sourced from a single vineyard, this is an intensely minerally Champagne. It is dry and austere, with citrus fruits dominant. The wine needs to age to bring out all of the richness and toast flavor, but it will always be a structured Champagne. This is very much a food wine.\tClos des Bouveries Blanc de Blancs Brut\t91\t65\tChampagne\tChampagne\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDuval-Leroy 2005 Clos des Bouveries Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)\tChardonnay\tDuval-Leroy\tGT_90_Points\n30186\tSpain\tPiercing aromas of grapy blackberry are full-on and a touch hot. This ripe bruiser is plump and chunky in feel, with hard tannins. Luscious flavors of boysenberry, blackberry and herbs end with oaky fanfare, length and clarity. Drink through 2023.\t\t92\t45\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio de Atauta 2011  Ribera del Duero\tTinto Fino\tDominio de Atauta\tGT_90_Points\n71782\tUS\tFeral strawberry grabs all the attention in this wildly fierce, high-acid wine that packs a punch in texture, tannin power and body. Small amounts of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah figure into the blend, which is made in minuscule amounts.\t\t90\t42\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tCrux 2014 Grenache (Russian River Valley)\tGrenache\tCrux\tGT_90_Points\n15456\tUS\tNamed after Bill Foley's jingle-writing mother , this wine sings, starting with the starry shine in the glass. Aromas of light salmon brittle turn to apple blossoms, and then a sip reveals sea salt, lemon rind and poached apple, with a nutty macadamia paste note throughout.\tZoula Nunn\t93\t35\tCalifornia\tSta.

Rita Hills)\tChardonnay\tLincourt\tGT_90_Points\n10603\tFrance\tWith Hubert de Bouärd (whose family owns Château Angélus in Bordeaux) as consultant, this estate has produced a ripe wine that has the crispest, purest fruit flavors. Red berries and apples shoot through the lightly tannic texture. The wine will be better from late 2016.\tImpatience\t91\t19\tProvence\tCôtes de Provence\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tChâteau de Berne 2015 Impatience Rosé (Côtes de Provence)\tRosé\tChâteau de Berne\tGT_90_Points\n118678\tUS\tWild earth and forest floor surround elements of truffle, black tea and cardamom in this vineyard-designate, a savory and wholly compelling wine.

Blackened flavors of burnt wood, coffee and berry fruit lead to a smacking tannic finish.

Feels softly lush and luxurious, with potent blackberry and cherry-pie filling, raspberry liqueur, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood flavors. Needs time to resolve its elements. Give it 5–6 years in a good cellar.\tOliver's Blend\t92\t105\tCalifornia\tAlexander Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tSkipstone 2005 Oliver's Blend Red (Alexander Valley)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tSkipstone\tGT_90_Points\n113795\tUS\tBlending Cabernet with 33% Petit Verdot might seem like folly indeed but it works on this wine. The aromas of flowers, vanilla and spice are quite reticent while the dark fruit flavors pack a well-balanced punch, with firm tannins and spritely, mouthwatering acids capturing the attention.\tDavid's Folly\t90\t36\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tArmstrong Family 2013 David's Folly Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tArmstrong Family\tGT_90_Points\n101993\tItaly\tHere's a flatter, perhaps more neutral expression of the fragrant Sauvignon variety that offers citrus-like zest in the mouth and tonic aromas of exotic fruit, papaya and mango. Pair this wine with appetizers or finger foods—but avoid anything with lemon because the wine already has a strong citric side.\t\t85\t19\tNortheastern Italy\tColli Orientali del Friuli\t\t\t\tGigante 2007 Sauvignon (Colli Orientali del Friuli)\tSauvignon\tGigante\tLT_90_Points\n33078\tUS\tWhile the nose is subdued, the palate of this semidry Riesling offers loads of fresh peach and yellow-cherry flavors.

For starters, the saturated bouquet is murky and less than fresh. In the mouth, expect a blocky, extracted mouthfeel and roasted flavors of herbal berry and raisin. Lastly, there's a tannic grab as well as particles and chunks floating about.\tUnfiltered\t83\t15\tCasablanca Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLoma Larga 2009 Unfiltered Merlot (Casablanca Valley)\tMerlot\tLoma Larga\tLT_90_Points\n82924\tUS\tThe scents and flavors carry more than a hint of grassiness, along the lines of Sauvignon Blanc. The high alcohol seems to strip the wine of its flesh. It's full throttle, with the mouthfeel and high-toned bite of a very ripe Viognier. It's definitely not your run-of-the-mill example of Oregon Pinot Gris.\tOregon\t86\t26\tOregon\tChehalem Mountains\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tHawks View 2015 Oregon Pinot Gris (Chehalem Mountains)\tPinot Gris\tHawks View\tLT_90_Points\n94886\tUS\tStrawberry and graphite meet with a rusty element on the nose of this easy-to-quaff and yet intriguing and well-priced wine.

Aromas of violet petals and slate rise above the norm, while the palate is rich, slick and tastes of truffle, licorice, pepper and blackberry. Fairly stylish and ready to drink now.

Coast\tCentral Coast\t\t\tInception 2009 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)\tPinot Noir\tInception\tLT_90_Points\tA fruity Pinot Noir, one-dimensional and ripe in raspberries, cherries and warm cola. It's a bit sweet, but pleasantly tart, with a nice, clean finish.\n35219\tUS\tMéthode Traditionelle Brut Rosé\t91\t44\tCalifornia\tNorth Coast\tNorth Coast\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tSchramsberg 2012 Méthode Traditionelle Brut Rosé Sparkling (North Coast)\tSparkling Blend\tSchramsberg\tGT_90_Points\tThis dry and sophisticated wine made from 77% Pinot Noir and 23% Chardonnay has just what's needed in a rosé. It has a vivid light-copper color, an aroma like red cherries and apple skin, and flavors that are bright and fresh. The balance is almost austere but rounds after a couple of sips.\n65668\tUS\tToboni Vineyard\t87\t45\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tOakwild Ranch 2011 Toboni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tOakwild Ranch\tLT_90_Points\tBrick red in color, this vineyard-designated Pinot offers aromas of rose geranium before delving into soft, earthy notes laced in strawberry and oak. The wine is not overly ripe nor tannic, and finishes with a medium length.\n112745\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t33\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tÉbano 2006 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tÉbano\tLT_90_Points\tStarts out oaky and cheesy, with baked berry, leather and clove-like aromas. The palate has lots of size, clacky tannins and acidity, while flavors of berry, mocha and tobacco are nice and lead to a toasty, grabby finish. Typical for RDD in that it's tough and tannic but full of brash flavor; drink now–2015.\n54686\tEngland\tClassic Cuvée\t92\t\tEngland\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl MW\t@AnneInVino\tHattingley Valley Wines 2013 Classic Cuvée Sparkling (England)\tSparkling Blend\tHattingley Valley Wines\tGT_90_Points\tCreamy apple, lemon shortbread and fresh citrus make for a convincing trio of aromas. They continue their merry dance on the generous, dry and poised palate to achieve real elegance. All the while there is a deeper, hidden core that draws you in, speaking of stone and honeycomb. With its tiny, pin-prick bubbles this is utterly charming and grown-up, harmonious and poised.\n104709\tAustria\tAuslese\t86\t\tThermenregion\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tJohanneshof Reinisch 2011 Auslese Rotgipfler (Thermenregion)\tRotgipfler\tJohanneshof Reinisch\tLT_90_Points\tBrown sugar and dark treacle flavors dominate this rich, sweet wine. With its opulent texture, this is for sipping. Screwcap.\n73361\tFrance\t\t85\t64\tBurgundy\tChambolle-Musigny\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tJaffelin 2009  Chambolle-Musigny\tPinot Noir\tJaffelin\tLT_90_Points\tA tight wine, this is dominated by acids, red fruits and firm tannins, and it's missing some of the richness of the vintage. It has a closed feeling, and it needs some months to develop, but this will always be dry.\n120565\tChile\t\t88\t17\tApalta\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAwning 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Apalta)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tAwning\tLT_90_Points\tRipe berry aromas are heady. In the mouth, this hard-edged Cabernet is gritty and smacking. Ripe plum and blackberry flavors are backed by hefty but pulling tannins, and overall the texture is quite rough.\n122792\tUS\tTwenty Six\t93\t80\tCalifornia\tSanta Ynez Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tProximity 2009 Twenty Six Red (Santa Ynez Valley)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tProximity\tGT_90_Points\tBased on Petit Verdot, with the other four Bordeaux varieties blended in, this is ripe and rich in blackberries, mocha and oak. It distinguishes itself from Napa Valley—which is the unavoidable comparison—with a pleasurable earthiness and tartness, reflecting the Santa Ynez's cool climate.\n108496\tUS\t\t88\t18\tOregon\tSouthern Oregon\tSouthern Oregon\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tAbacela 2005 Merlot (Southern Oregon)\tMerlot\tAbacela\tLT_90_Points\tOregon Merlots have darker fruits and streaks of tar and smoke. Tannins are more aggressive, and must be carefully managed. This wine does a pretty good job of softening up the back end while keeping the richness up front. There is plenty of acid, and the nose carries interesting scents of sandalwood and milk chocolate. It's just a bit chalky on the finish.\n11169\tUS\t\t84\t35\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\t\t\tDomaine Chandon 2005 Pinot Meunier (Carneros)\tPinot Meunier\tDomaine Chandon\tLT_90_Points\tThis variety is commonly used in Champagne but rarely vinified on its own. This wine shows why. It's like Pinot Noir in the silky texture, but feels jagged and harsh, and the fruit tastes a little baked and sugary.\n70736\tUS\t\t83\t35\tCalifornia\tRutherford\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tEaglewood 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tEaglewood\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a dull, tannic and robustly full bodied wine, brooding in tobacco and tea without much in the way of fruit or acidity.\n108632\tUS\tPeltier Station\t82\t18\tCalifornia\tLodi\tCentral Valley\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tPeltier 2010 Peltier Station Zinfandel (Lodi)\tZinfandel\tPeltier\tLT_90_Points\tThis Zin tastes of smoke, oak and grilled meats, but has an odd acidity to it. It would be good paired with something off the barbecue.\n122872\tAustria\t\t91\t20\tVienna\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl MW\t@AnneInVino\tWieninger 2016 Riesling (Vienna)\tRiesling\tWieninger\tGT_90_Points\tAppetizing notes of Cox Orange Pippin and ripe red apples with lemon zest make up the nose of this fruity wine. The palate gives them full rein, adding a funky tone of yeast. This wine is characterized by intense, refreshing juiciness that ripples across the palate in fruity abandon. It's dry and refreshing.\n5734\tFrance\t\t90\t30\tProvence\tBandol\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDomaine de la Bégude 2014 Rosé (Bandol)\tRosé\tDomaine de la Bégude\tGT_90_Points\tWith 60% Mourvèdre, this blend is rich and spicy. It has great acidity, still fresh and accented by red and citrus fruits. Minerality and an herbal element come from the garrigue that surrounds the vines. The wine has certainly benefited from a year's aging.\n106555\tUS\t\t85\t17\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tMercer Canyons 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))\tCabernet Sauvignon\tMercer Canyons\tLT_90_Points\tThis serviceable red blend includes smaller amounts of Merlot and Syrah, with tart red fruits and drying tannins. It dries out the mouth with a chalky sensation, suggesting it would be best enjoyed with red meat.\n106823\tUS\tEn Cerise Vineyard\t94\t80\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tCayuse 2013 En Cerise Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))\tSyrah\tCayuse\tGT_90_Points\tThe aromas pop with notes of funk, smoked meat, red fruit, flowers, stems and orange peel. It's compact out of the gate with concentrated, tightly wound, salty flavors of olive brine, crushed rock and violets. It shows an exquisite sense of balance and a crazy long finish.\n10746\tUS\tQuarter Mile Lane Vineyard\t94\t90\tOregon\tChehalem Mountains\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tAdelsheim 2008 Quarter Mile Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)\tPinot Noir\tAdelsheim\tGT_90_Points\tSadly, just 44 cases were produced, from Block 1 of the original estate vineyard. Rhubarb, cherry, cinnamon and suggestions of light tropical fruits are delicately entwined here. It would be easy to skip over the wine's complexity; you must let it breathe open and it will reward you with fascinating, subtle layers that slowly unravel.\n35956\tUS\tRoma En Chamberlin Vineyard\t94\t60\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tK Vintners 2008 Roma En Chamberlin Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))\tCabernet Sauvignon-Syrah\tK Vintners\tGT_90_Points\tA similar blend to the Ovide; this is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon and 38% Syrah. The fruit is more forward here, with pretty blackberry and black cherry flavors, and a dark and forceful streak of iron and charcoal and licorice. A light lavender note adds interest.\n9723\tUS\t\t90\t24\tOregon\tWalla Walla Valley (OR)\tOregon Other\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tWatermill 2012 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR))\tSyrah\tWatermill\tGT_90_Points\tAromas of café au lait, woodspice and dark fruit lead to full-bodied, hedonistic coffee flavors. The style is rich, mixing fruit and barrel.\n46407\tUS\t\t85\t24\tCalifornia\tSanta Cruz Mountains\tCentral Coast\t\t\tBargetto 2006 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)\tPinot Noir\tBargetto\tLT_90_Points\tSimple and easy, with crisp coastal acidity that provides balance to the cola, cherry, tangerine and pomegranate flavors. Made to be opened now, this Pinot will be good with roast salmon and broiled chicken.\n96522\tUS\tGhielmetti Vineyard\t86\t15\tCalifornia\tLivermore Valley\tCentral Coast\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tFenestra 2011 Ghielmetti Vineyard Semillon (Livermore Valley)\tSémillon\tFenestra\tLT_90_Points\tWith overtones of lemon, vanilla and oak, this fleshy Semillon tastes big and needs strong flavors to complement its heft. The finish features a lingering richness.\n21309\tItaly\tD'Amblè\t85\t22\tPiedmont\tLanghe\t\t\t\tOrlando Abrigo 2009 D'Amblè Sauvignon (Langhe)\tSauvignon\tOrlando Abrigo\tLT_90_Points\tHere's a crisp, mineral-driven Sauvignon from northern Italy with background aromas of peach, honeydew melon and white peach. The wine shows medium consistency and good staying power with a dry, crisp finish.\n32360\tItaly\t\t89\t24\tNortheastern Italy\tCollio\t\tKerin O’Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tSchiopetto 2015 Pinot Grigio (Collio)\tPinot Grigio\tSchiopetto\tLT_90_Points\tThis opens with delicate aromas reminiscent of white spring flower and a whiff of orchard fruit. On the palate, fresh acidity underscores creamy Bartlett pear and nectarine zest that lead to a clean, bright finish.\n22520\tFrance\tLes Grèves Premier Cru\t94\t\tBurgundy\tBeaune\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDomaine des Croix 2014 Les Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune)\tPinot Noir\tDomaine des Croix\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine is perfumed with cherries and red berries. Its structure, which is certainly there, is almost secondary to this brilliant fruit. Balanced with a mineral dryness, the wine is certainly going to age into a ripe, pure-fruited wine. Drink from 2020.\n32932\tAustria\t1000-Eimerberg Smaragd\t88\t29\tWachau\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tGritsch Mauritiushof 2007 1000-Eimerberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)\tRiesling\tGritsch Mauritiushof\tLT_90_Points\tThe crispness is paramount here, maybe too much, meaning that the wine is very green. Of course, this is Riesling and is way too young now.

This is a softer, less tannic wine than most of the other Torii Mor 2005s, but is not quite what you would call silky. Mixed red fruits, light scents suggesting flower as well as berry, and a feminine elegance characterize this Pinot. It's been carefully crafted to emphasize the subtle herbs and spices, without hiding behind the more obvious flavors of new oak.\n8626\tPortugal\tMonte da Cal Colheita Seleccionada\t86\t9\tAlentejano\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tGlobal Wines 2016 Monte da Cal Colheita Seleccionada Red (Alentejano)\tPortuguese Red\tGlobal Wines\tLT_90_Points\tThis soft ripe wine is smooth and velvet textured.

Rich, slightly sweet flavors blend savory, almost salty accents with fruit on the way to a soft finish.\n52186\tUS\tHyde Vineyard\t90\t58\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\t\t\tPatz & Hall 2010 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)\tChardonnay\tPatz & Hall\tGT_90_Points\tDon't drink this Chardonnay too cold, as it needs a little while in the glass to show its stuff. Right off the bat, it's austere, but when it airs, the tropical fruit, orange and oak complexities come out. The parts have not yet come together, though, so give it 3–4 years to develop.\n72198\tSpain\t\t86\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNebla 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tNebla\tLT_90_Points\tPeach and citrus aromas are offset by green, herbal notes of bell pepper and lettuce leaf. This feels spritzy and lively, with passion fruit and pink grapefruit flavors. Dry and pithy on the finish.\n52520\tSpain\tCala N.1\t87\t15\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTinedo 2014 Cala N.1 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tRed Blend\tTinedo\tLT_90_Points\tSpunky aromas of red plum and red-berry fruits are fresh. This wine feels dry, chalky and tannic. Berry and plum flavors come with a hint of chocolate and spice on a choppy finish.\n29321\tFrance\t\t92\t25\tSouthwest France\tPécharmant\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tChâteau de Corbiac 2005  Pécharmant\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tChâteau de Corbiac\tGT_90_Points\tMaturing well, this wine shows 2005's combination of richness and structure. It is built around firm, dusty tannins and big black-currant flavors, with a fine perfumed character from the wood aging. Ready to drink in a year, but it should age for several more.\n2624\tUS\tReserve\t82\t18\tCalifornia\tEdna Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tNorman 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (Edna Valley)\tChardonnay\tNorman\tLT_90_Points\tSharp and green, with a minty, chlorophyll taste.

It's buoyed by ample natural acidity and adorned with highlights of pastry and baking spices. It expands gracefully as it breathes, adding volume and density. Give this extra cellar time. It should drink best from 2018–2030.\n108616\tFrance\tBarrel Sample\t92\t\tBordeaux\tSaint-Émilion\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tChâteau Dassault 2012 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tChâteau Dassault\tGT_90_Points\t91–93. Barrel sample. This solid wine is dark with tannins and a dense, extracted texture. The palate is weighty with an intensely dry core and a serious, mineral character. For long-term aging.\n116468\tUS\t\t88\t32\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tTines 2013 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)\tPetite Sirah\tTines\tLT_90_Points\tProduced by the Terravant facility in Buellton, this shows lots of smoked pork and bacon fat against a boysenberry-fruit frame on the nose. Flavors are quite sanguine, with iron and blood elements, as well as more smoke and some dried herbs.\n61226\tItaly\t\t87\t21\tSouthern Italy\tPrimitivo di Manduria\t\t\t\tFeudi di San Gregorio 2010  Primitivo di Manduria\tPrimitivo\tFeudi di San Gregorio\tLT_90_Points\tSweet spice, rum cake and dark plum open the nose of this dark and savory Primitivo. It is chewy and dense, with loads of ripe black-cherry flavor on the finish.\n111583\tUS\tPutnam Vineyard Rosé of\t90\t25\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tTongue Dancer 2016 Putnam Vineyard Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)\tPinot Noir\tTongue Dancer\tGT_90_Points\tProof that that a pink wine can be as serious as it is delicious, this copper-tinged wine from James MacPhail offers almond, cured meat, raspberry, melon and lemon peel flavors. No shrinking violet here; it's at once crisp, fleshy and fully expressive.\n74754\tUS\t\t90\t20\tCalifornia\tMendocino\t\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tNavarro 2016 Rosé (Mendocino)\tRosé\tNavarro\tGT_90_Points\tThis is an excellent rosé with some red-wine character showing through the pale-salmon color and fresh fruitiness. It has slightly meaty, spicy and cherry-like flavors, a good balance between medium body and firm acidity, and a nice tangy finish.\n102403\tItaly\tTasnim\t86\t19\tNortheastern Italy\tVigneti delle Dolomiti\t\tKerin O’Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tLoacker 2012 Tasnim Sauvignon Blanc (Vigneti delle Dolomiti)\tSauvignon Blanc\tLoacker\tLT_90_Points\tNot very expressive, it opens with subdued aromas that recall lemon peel and toast. These carry over to the palate along with a note of butterscotch. There's not enough fruit richness to support the racy acidity.\n28997\tChile\tPetirrojo Reserva Estate Grown\t84\t8\tColchagua Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Bisquertt 2014 Petirrojo Reserva Estate Grown Merlot (Colchagua Valley)\tMerlot\tViña Bisquertt\tLT_90_Points\tBriny, rubbery aromas of asphalt and blackberry set up a fat, wide palate. Herbal, green-infused berry flavors finish with notes of carob, herbs and field greens. The round mouthfeel and textural balance are this wine's strong points.\n127768\tItaly\t\t91\t54\tTuscany\tBrunello di Montalcino\t\t\t\tS. Lucia 2004  Brunello di Montalcino\tSangiovese Grosso\tS. Lucia\tGT_90_Points\tWhat a difference a year can make. Last year's Brunello was ripe and awkward, but this pretty 2004 vintage hits all the right notes. The wine is firm, tonic and buoyant and those impressions are sustained thanks to uplifting aromas of wild berry, cherry cola and spice.\n63807\tSpain\tRosé\t82\t18\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\t1+1=3 2008 Rosé Cabernet Sauvignon (Penedès)\tCabernet Sauvignon\t1+1=3\tLT_90_Points\tThe previous two years we did not find this wine to be worthy of a rating. This time, we rate it but note that it's an almost-red wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon. It's sweet smelling, with fiery plum-skin flavors that evaporate along with the mouthfeel. Leaves a burn patch on the finish. Particular to the max.\n116276\tFrance\tLes Ravinets\t90\t19\tBeaujolais\tJuliénas\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tFerraud et Fils 2009 Les Ravinets  (Juliénas)\tGamay\tFerraud et Fils\tGT_90_Points\tFirm wine that is packed with tannins as well as solid fruit. The wine is concentrated with a dense plum skin texture. Chunky, perfumed and solid.\n24482\tUS\t\t90\t23\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tRobert Mondavi 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley)\tMerlot\tRobert Mondavi\tGT_90_Points\tThis bold red wine works its magic by offering hearty helpings of yeasty brioche, baked, stewed plum, black pepper and clove, remaining varietal and unabashed in its hold on the ripe vintage and sun-kissed appellation. Integrated, the tannin imprint is sizable, yet well managed.\n14916\tItaly\t500ml\t87\t51\tSicily & Sardinia\tPassito di Pantelleria\t\t\t\tColosi 2006 500ml  (Passito di Pantelleria)\tZibibbo\tColosi\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with a thick amber color and aromas of peppermint, apricot, white mineral and lavender honey. There's a floral component in the mouth but this wine also offers distinctive flavors of dried grass or herbs.\n64464\tUS\tThe Grape Republic\t88\t25\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tLachini 2014 The Grape Republic Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)\tPinot Noir\tLachini\tLT_90_Points\tForward with pretty raspberry and cherry fruit, this delightful, easy-drinking wine has a pleasantly earthy underpinning. It's young and tart, immediately enjoyable but can cellar through 2021.\n940\tFrance\tGrande Réserve Premier Cru Brut\t87\t38\tChampagne\tChampagne\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDuménil NV Grande Réserve Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)\tChampagne Blend\tDuménil\tLT_90_Points\tNeatly divided between the three major grapes of Champagne, this full, ripe wine is packed with rich apple and pear fruits. It is crisp while showing a high dosage giving a softer, smoother aftertaste. Drink this bottling now.\n72434\tFrance\t\t84\t16\tLoire Valley\tRosé d'Anjou\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tChâteau de Fesles 2010  Rosé d'Anjou\tRosé\tChâteau de Fesles\tLT_90_Points\tWith some weight, this has raspberry flavor to go with its sweetness. Berry fruits dominate in a wine that is full in the mouth.\n44418\tUS\t\t91\t30\tCalifornia\tHigh Valley\t\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tHigh Valley Vineyard 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (High Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tHigh Valley Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\tTouches of cedar and fresh-cut oak in the aroma join ripe but dry fruit flavors and firm tannins on the palate. Well structured for mid-term aging, this wine will be best after 2019.\n40373\tUS\t\t91\t24\tCalifornia\tSan Benito County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tPessagno Winery 2011 Zinfandel (San Benito County)\tZinfandel\tPessagno Winery\tGT_90_Points\tA lighter style Zinfandel, it's also lighter in color. Aromas align more with fresh minerality than deep fruit, though there is tobacco, plum jam and some pepper on the nose. Once sipped, cranberry and pomegranate compete for the fruit side, while cedar and pepper form the spice element. It's great for sipping on the porch and shows how Zinfandel can be impressively lean, even with 14.7% alcohol.\n37381\tFrance\t\t88\t15\tProvence\tCôtes de Provence\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tChâteau de Vaucouleurs 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)\tRosé\tChâteau de Vaucouleurs\tLT_90_Points\tOrganically grown grapes have resulted in a soft, crisp and clean wine. It has bright pure fruits with white-peach and red-currant flavors along with stylish acidity. The wine is ready to drink.\n107163\tFrance\tCuvée René Dopff\t86\t24\tAlsace\tAlsace\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDopff & Irion 2012 Cuvée René Dopff Gewurztraminer (Alsace)\tGewürztraminer\tDopff & Irion\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a gently spicy wine with notes of ginger and cinnamon as well as ripe tropical fruits. It is not a complex wine, but very approachable even at this stage and touched with some acidity on the finish.\n24545\tPortugal\tTinto Real\t86\t\tAlentejano\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tJulian Reynolds 2009 Tinto Real Red (Alentejano)\tPortuguese Red\tJulian Reynolds\tLT_90_Points\tThere is a distinct barnyard aroma to this wine. The palate seems more clean, and it offers firm, red berry fruits and tannins. A blend of Trincadeira, Aragones and Alicante Bouschet, this is fruity and structured.\n97928\tUS\t\t85\t10\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\t\t\tMeridian 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tMeridian\tLT_90_Points\tComes down on the rustic side, but for the price it's pretty good for a dry Cabernet. Shows the variety's full-bodied fanciness in the blackberry, currant, cocoa and licorice flavors, with a rich steak of vanilla oak.\n1659\tUS\tSams Valley Vineyard\t85\t25\tOregon\tSouthern Oregon\tSouthern Oregon\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tCliff Creek 2011 Sams Valley Vineyard Claret (Southern Oregon)\tClaret\tCliff Creek\tLT_90_Points\tRoughly equal portions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot go into this tannic blend. It may be a little too far along the aging curve, at least for showing much fruit. It's drying out—displaying a touch of leather—and should be consumed as soon as possible.\n73694\tUS\t\t91\t36\tCalifornia\tSonoma Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tLedson 1999 Merlot (Sonoma Valley)\tMerlot\tLedson\tGT_90_Points\tQuite rich and distinguished, with the full-bodied weight and rich, thick tannins of a fine Cabernet, yet with Merlot's flavors of cherries, plums, and violets, with a white chocolate edge. Impresses for its youthful purity and deliciousness, as well as the refined texture.\n48655\tUS\tMorisoli Vineyard\t92\t60\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tV. Sattui 2008 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tV. Sattui\tGT_90_Points\tLots of rich, heady flavors in this delicious young Cabernet Sauvignon. It appeals now for the intense blackberry, cherry, cassis, dark chocolate and anise flavors, but such is the tannic intensity that it should easily age. Hold until 2015 and try again.\n30182\tPortugal\tVilla Oliveira Tinto\t92\t60\tDão\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCasa da Passarella 2011 Villa Oliveira Tinto Touriga Nacional (Dão)\tTouriga Nacional\tCasa da Passarella\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a seriously dense wine—very structured and also with swathes of generous black plum and berry fruits. It is mineral in character, dark with firm tannins and still showing intense acidity that will need to soften. Drink this concentrated wine from 2018.\n54951\tPortugal\tCarvalhas Vinhas Velhas\t93\t60\tDouro\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tQuinta das Carvalhas 2012 Carvalhas Vinhas Velhas Red (Douro)\tPortuguese Red\tQuinta das Carvalhas\tGT_90_Points\tFrom old vines, this is the estate wine of Carvalhas. Black in color, it is hugely rich, dense and brooding. The wine is still young, pushed forward by tannins as much as fruit and packed with a concentrated structure. Spice at the end and a dry aftertaste need time to soften. Drink from 2018.\n120511\tAustria\tDie Leidenschaft\t89\t\tNiederösterreich\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tArndorfer 2008 Die Leidenschaft Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)\tGrüner Veltliner\tArndorfer\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a mature Grüner that's rich, ripe and deliciously smooth. It has a great depth of flavor, with notes of wild herb and passion fruit that are balanced with mature acidity.\n119106\tUS\tDutton Ranch\t88\t46\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tAnaba 2012 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tAnaba\tLT_90_Points\tA bite of spicy wild strawberry marks this wine in flavor and aroma, complementing the soft, lush layers that follow. A candied, marshmallow-like quality gives the wine a sense of ripeness that is probably more pronounced aromatically than otherwise. The sense of sweetness is offset by balanced acidity and a lengthy, spicy finish.\n27619\tSouth Africa\t\t88\t13\tStellenbosch\t\t\t\t\tJardin 1999 Fumé Blanc (Stellenbosch)\tFumé Blanc\tJardin\tLT_90_Points\tBarrel fermented in French oak, this wine is made in a full style with plenty of nut, herb and fig aromas and flavors. Big, even fat on the palate, it offers considerable weight and texture. The lengthy finish with herb and mineral accents is particularly appealing.\n39995\tSpain\tRosado\t84\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCoto de Hayas 2007 Rosado Rosé (Campo de Borja)\tRosé\tCoto de Hayas\tLT_90_Points\tRed in color and pretty clean on the nose, where raspberry and rose petal essence come together. The palate is acidic and tight, with tangy watermelon and peach flavors carrying the cleansing finish. Juicy to the extreme, but a good partner for food.\n2090\tUS\tBeet Red\t90\t19\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tSuLei 2007 Beet Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))\tRed Blend\tSuLei\tGT_90_Points\tA nicely crafted debut from a new Walla Walla boutique. The blend—two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrah—is becoming a classic in Walla Walla. This wraps delicious caramel around bright berries and plums. It's nicely focused, smooth and compact, but feels like a wine that will flesh out with a bit more bottle age.\n97717\tAustria\tAnning\t91\t19\tThermenregion\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl MW\t@AnneInVino\tStadlmann 2016 Anning Rotgipfler (Thermenregion)\tRotgipfler\tStadlmann\tGT_90_Points\tTender notes of ripe Mirabelle plum play on the nose alongside an earthier element. The palate becomes fuller and fruitier, expressing more of that juicy Mirabelle on its lemon-toned and streamlined body with a zesty texture. The finish is lip-smacking and bright, echoing with lemony fruit.\n67437\tUS\tElivette\t94\t150\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tSpring Mountain Vineyard 2012 Elivette Red (Napa Valley)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tSpring Mountain Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\tBeginning with a velvety texture and inviting bouquet of strawberry and rose, this classic blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 8% Petit Verdot and 2% Merlot is grown on the winery's 845-acre estate atop Spring Mountain. Kirsch, black pepper and chocolate combine atop a smooth, integrated palate that's elegant from start to finish, the oak tempered to good effect. Drink now through 2027.\n70966\tFrance\tTerres Blanches\t92\t40\tLoire Valley\tPouilly-Fumé\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tPascal Jolivet 2015 Terres Blanches  (Pouilly-Fumé)\tSauvignon Blanc\tPascal Jolivet\tGT_90_Points\tJolivet has crossed the Loire from his home in Sancerre to produce this full-bodied wine that comes from clay and chalk soil. It is textured with acidity and minerality, while the white fruit of this young wine is forward and juicy. The wine, like so many from Pouilly, needs to age. Drink from 2018.\n16097\tPortugal\tSegada Branco\t83\t8\tLisboa\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDFJ Vinhos 2010 Segada Branco White (Lisboa)\tPortuguese White\tDFJ Vinhos\tLT_90_Points\tRipe and fruity, with some sweetness that does not seem to be fully integrated. So the green plum flavors are attractive, as is the acidity, but there is an intrusive sugary edge.\n101605\tUS\tPalengat\t92\t85\tWashington\tHorse Heaven Hills\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tQuilceda Creek 2007 Palengat Red (Horse Heaven Hills)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tQuilceda Creek\tGT_90_Points\tQuilceda's Palengat is now a proprietary blend, not a strict Cabernet as before. You can smell the violets amidst nicely layered aromatics, built upon layers of black fruits, cassis and dark, smoky elements. Smoke, earth, coffee, a hint of iron and rock continue into the midpalate, which loses a little density as it moves through the finish. That may be a reflection of the young-ish (7 to 10 year old) vines.\n97790\tUS\t\t88\t20\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tLamoreaux Landing 2013 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)\tPinot Noir\tLamoreaux Landing\tLT_90_Points\tViolet and lavender lend a floral tone to this very pretty Pinot. Brisk and bright, it balances delicate red berry and cherry flavors against subtle shades of toast and oak. It's irresistibly refreshing and quaffable.\n31653\tUS\tPatelin de Tablas Blanc\t85\t20\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\t\t\tTablas Creek 2012 Patelin de Tablas Blanc White (Paso Robles)\tRhône-style White Blend\tTablas Creek\tLT_90_Points\tBlended from Grenache Blanc, Viognier, Roussanne and Marsanne, this is a fine wine for drinking now. It's dry and acidic and even a little tannic, with subtle apricot, tobacco and orange rind flavors.\n14781\tUS\tEternal Sunshine\t91\t35\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tEternal 2015 Eternal Sunshine Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA))\tViognier\tEternal\tGT_90_Points\tVibrant aromas of white flowers, ripe peach, fresh herb, cocoa butter and hard candy lead to nuanced, well-balanced fruit flavors that show just a touch of lees influence. It offers an exquisite sense of balance and depth along with an extended finish.\n19145\tUS\tHome Ranch Vineyard\t92\t45\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tMonticello Vineyards 2001 Home Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley)\tChardonnay\tMonticello Vineyards\tGT_90_Points\tThis is stunningly good single-vineyard wine. The fruit shows well-ripened apples and peaches all the way into pineapples and mangoes, offering up a cascade of flavors that tumble across the palate. Oak shadings are generous, but in balance. Displays a crispness and delicacy of acids more usually associated with cooler regions. Absolutely first class.\n74317\tSpain\tViña Trebolar\t89\t33\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Navarro López 2009 Viña Trebolar Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Navarro López\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a throwback wine with complex aromas, intriguing flavors and a light-to-medium body. The blend is Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, and the end product offers cinnamon, orange peel and tea aromas in front of an acid-rich palate, with spiced cranberry, dried fruit and citrus flavors. Elegant and feminine in style; drink now–2018. Fewer than 2,400 bottles produced.\n86580\tFrance\tCuvée la Fleur Tabenot\t85\t20\tBordeaux\tCôtes de Castillon\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tChâteau Hyot 2006 Cuvée la Fleur Tabenot  (Côtes de Castillon)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tChâteau Hyot\tLT_90_Points\tWith much of the freshness of 2006 now evolved into more mature flavors, this balanced if somewhat stalky wine has fine perfumed black currant fruit flavors, with a firm core of tannins and wood aging.\n19094\tItaly\tPetaso\t87\t27\tTuscany\tRosso di Montepulciano\t\tKerin O’Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tMontemercurio 2013 Petaso  (Rosso di Montepulciano)\tRed Blend\tMontemercurio\tLT_90_Points\tChopped herb, underbrush, truffle and balsamic notes lead the nose. The palate is fresh, vibrant and polished, offering sour cherry fruit with a hint of licorice. A sage note closes the finish.\n96802\tItaly\tPremstaler\t90\t29\tNortheastern Italy\tAlto Adige\t\t\t\tKellerei Kaltern Caldaro 2011 Premstaler Sauvignon (Alto Adige)\tSauvignon\tKellerei Kaltern Caldaro\tGT_90_Points\tThis Sauvignon opens with beautiful aromas of exotic fruit, citrus, dried sage and a touch of cinnamon spice at the back. The mouthfeel is smooth and dense with a crisp, but creamy aftertaste.\n520\tUS\tDoux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard\t91\t35\tCalifornia\tEdna Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tQupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley)\tMarsanne\tQupé\tGT_90_Points\tBob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff.\n128911\tChile\tReserva\t88\t12\tColchagua Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa Silva 2011 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tCasa Silva\tLT_90_Points\tSmells neither tropical nor citric as it falls somewhere in the middle of those two common denominators. Feels wet, fresh and minerally, with flavors of lime, green melon, sour apple, green herbs and mineral. Clean, well-cut and tight on the finish, with zesty length.\n78921\tSpain\tBlanco\t86\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\t\t\tIzadi 2000 Blanco Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tIzadi\tLT_90_Points\tNo cookie-cutter white,  this 80% Viura and 20% Malvasia barrel-aged Rioja has vibrant aromas and flavors. The Malvasia's decidedly orange cast plays off the nuttier Viura and wood notes. Closes dry and toasty, decently long, with a faint bitter almond note. Unique, and tasty for drinking now. —M.M.\n76589\tUS\t\t94\t40\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tAbeja 2012 Chardonnay (Walla Walla Valley (WA))\tChardonnay\tAbeja\tGT_90_Points\tThis is the estate bottling, barrel-fermented in French oak and put through full malolactic. Spice and toast frame perfectly ripened tree fruit flavors of apple, pear and orange peel. The concentration and length suggest that this Chardonnay can be cellared for up to a decade.\n37912\tFrance\t\t84\t18\tAlsace\tAlsace\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDopff & Irion 2010 Sylvaner (Alsace)\tSylvaner\tDopff & Irion\tLT_90_Points\tWith considerable acidity, this has a taut line in citrus, the greenest apple and just a touch of spice. It is not for aging, drink now.\n55842\tUS\tSteelhead Run Vineyard Blessed\t87\t23\tOregon\tRogue Valley\tSouthern Oregon\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tSchultz 2012 Steelhead Run Vineyard Blessed Merlot (Rogue Valley)\tMerlot\tSchultz\tLT_90_Points\tThis full-bodied wine shows smooth and rounded plum fruit.

The tannins are sturdy from this blend of the two Cabernets, Sauvignon and Franc, which was grown on the lower slopes of Howell Mountain. Yet it's so sweet and fruity, you can drink it now. Misses some of the complexity of the 2007 vintage, but still very fine and polished.\n104951\tChile\tReserva\t86\t13\tColchagua Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCalcu 2011 Reserva Rosé (Colchagua Valley)\tRosé\tCalcu\tLT_90_Points\tLight pink to the eye, then fresh and vital on the nose, with a touch of stalkiness.

In the mouth, however, this is a fresh wine with tomatoey acidity. Flavors of baked berry, plum and raisin blend with herbal notes, while the finish is long and tastes of vanilla and spice.\n35616\tUS\t\t91\t18\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tGirard 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tGirard\tGT_90_Points\tJuicy, with a firmness of acidity and a tenacious crispness, this wine evolves in the glass, shedding some of its wet stone and green apple for more voluptuous tenets of Asian pear and nutmeg.

It's not a bad assessment. Ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit highlight the broad midpalate, with a modest hint of leather, clean earth and toast.

Initial notes of balsamic blow off to reveal notes of brandied cherries and dried hay. Medium in weight, with fine, sandy tannins, the palate is condensed and ripe in fresh cherry tones that linger on the finish. As a result of the drying process, the alcohol hits over 15%, yet beyond the roundness on the palate, it's quite imperceptible.\n114700\tUS\tWeinbau Vineyard Block 18\t88\t56\tWashington\tWahluke Slope\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

With many hours of breathing it fleshes out and opens up, revealing a wine with interesting nuances of cured meat, mushroom and light earth. The fruit is a notch more concentrated and full than the regular DDO, but retains a sense of tart berry and light cherry rather than being sweet or jammy. This absolutely must be decanted well in advance.\n20369\tUS\tDurell Vineyard Origin\t93\t48\tCalifornia\tSonoma Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tThree Sticks 2011 Durell Vineyard Origin Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)\tChardonnay\tThree Sticks\tGT_90_Points\tThis is possibly the richest, ripest unoaked Chardonnay ever made in California.

It's already hinting at maturity with touches of cookie and toast flavors. There is still a fresh apple and citrus streak that gives a steel, mineral thrust at the end.\n81450\tUS\tVina Selecta\t85\t29\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tRiaza NV Vina Selecta Red (California)\tTempranillo Blend\tRiaza\tLT_90_Points\tA proprietary red blend, nonvintage and nonappellation-specific beyond California, this is a soft, thin rendition of Tempranillo and friends, boasting notes of game and pepper that might do well alongside a roast chicken (or duck) coated in buttery herbs.\n38582\tUS\t\t87\t17\tCalifornia\tMendocino-Lake County-Napa\tNorth Coast\t\t\tHess 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino-Lake County-Napa)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tHess\tLT_90_Points\tA very nice, elegant and clean Cab that shows plenty of coastal climate balance.

The mouthfeel is tight, and herbal notes come up ahead of the light red fruit. Whole cluster fermentation was employed, perhaps accounting for the woody accents in the tannins.\n33073\tUS\t\t88\t19\tCalifornia\tMonterey\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tEx 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey)\tSauvignon Blanc\tEx\tLT_90_Points\tVery clear in the glass, this bottling from the Wrath team shows honeydew, passionfruit, pine needle and a hint of wood on the nose.

At the same time, it has a fine layer of intense fruitiness, and it is crisp and packed with blackberry fruit. It has the typical minerality and structure of Juliénas, so give it 2–3 years.\n42584\tUS\tLia's Vineyard Jory Slope\t86\t24\tOregon\tChehalem Mountains\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tLongplay 2010 Lia's Vineyard Jory Slope Chardonnay (Chehalem Mountains)\tChardonnay\tLongplay\tLT_90_Points\tThis opens bearing scents suggesting banana and tropical fruit, with an oily character. On the palate, the flavor veers toward sour apple, with tart acids. The finish brings in a lick of butter, but at the moment it doesn't quite come together. This may benefit from more bottle age.\n43203\tItaly\tSuolo\t93\t120\tTuscany\tToscana\t\t\t\tArgiano 2005 Suolo Sangiovese (Toscana)\tSangiovese\tArgiano\tGT_90_Points\tSuolo is a beautiful accomplishment and one of the most pleasing and delicate expressions of Sangiovese to be found.

This Malbec (with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon) is mouth-filling and tight, with firm tannins. Pointed salty flavors of black plum and berry fruits finish with integrated spice and cocoa notes.

These notions persist on the palate where the peach and ripe yellow-plum notes are boosted by residual sweetness and countered by phenolic, slightly zesty but pleasant bitterness. You can feel the warmth on the medium-sweet finish. This is full on and rich, almost unctuous—perfect for blue cheeses.\n96381\tFrance\t\t88\t\tBordeaux\tPessac-Léognan\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tChâteau d'Alix 2013  Pessac-Léognan\tBordeaux-style White Blend\tChâteau d'Alix\tLT_90_Points\tA full, fruity and textured wine, this is ripe with quince and apple flavors that are freshened by the citrus acidity.

But the subtle hints of rock and spice that underlie the pristine cranberry fruit need some years to unwrap themselves. This new 2006 Schindler comes out swinging, its wild berry fruit laced with earthy, barnyard funk. Tastes like an unbridled mix of fruit and soil, spice and barrel, that adds up to a vibrant, earthy, alive Pinot.\n83258\tFrance\tBrut\t88\t40\tChampagne\tChampagne\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tLinard-Gontier NV Brut  (Champagne)\tChampagne Blend\tLinard-Gontier\tLT_90_Points\tThis cooperative, based in the Sézanne area south of Epernay, has produced an attractive blend of all three main Champagne grapes.

On the palate, this is rough as nails, with pounding tannins. Lead flavors of coconut, vanilla and chocolate are oak based, while the finish keeps that profile going. This is a big, dark, oaky wine with generic black-fruit character.\n83405\tUS\t\t91\t30\tOregon\tApplegate Valley\tSouthern Oregon\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tPlaisance Ranch 2012 Pinot Noir (Applegate Valley)\tPinot Noir\tPlaisance Ranch\tGT_90_Points\tBold and smoky, this offers tart, tight cherry and brambly berry fruit.

The ripe, firm palate shows mocha, black raspberry and licorice as well as a slightly green note of raw sage. A backbone of bracing tannins provides the tight framework.\n33230\tArgentina\tEl Tractor\t85\t10\tMendoza Province\tMendoza\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVilla Atuel 2012 El Tractor Malbec (Mendoza)\tMalbec\tVilla Atuel\tLT_90_Points\tLeather and earthy notes circle around core berry scents. This is medium bodied, with expansive but nonspecific berry and plum flavors. A wide, chunky finish is good but doesn't go beyond the basics.\n74991\tFrance\t\t88\t12\tBordeaux\tBordeaux\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tChâteau de Bordes-Quancard 2011  Bordeaux\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tChâteau de Bordes-Quancard\tLT_90_Points\tThe wine is full and ripe, generous both in its black fruits and its tannins.

The somewhat thin cranberry and raspberry fruit, high in acid, is not quite substantial enough to completely shed its candied character.\n98004\tSpain\tSelección\t86\t18\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBarinas 2014 Selección Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tBarinas\tLT_90_Points\tThis opens with bold but faintly chemical berry aromas. Its chunky palate features hard tannins, tasting of roasted berries, oak and cured meat.

Packed with tarry tannins, dark black fruits and hints of truffles, it is firm and full. The structure is still important in this wine, pushing forward around the fruit. Wait a while to drink from 2018.\n128028\tUS\t\t89\t45\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tButy 2011 Merlot-Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))\tMerlot-Cabernet Franc\tButy\tLT_90_Points\tSourced from the Conner Lee vineyard, this reflects the cool, difficult vintage, with a preponderance of herbal flavors. Cabernet Franc is given to showing an earthy, woodsy character in any event, and here it seems to rule. Highlights of baking spices, from aging 15 months in one-third new French oak, add flavor interest. With extensive breathing, the black cherry fruit comes up nicely. It should benefit from additional bottle age.\n15089\tItaly\t\t84\t19\tPiedmont\tAsti\t\t\t\tBera 2011 Moscato (Asti)\tMoscato\tBera\tLT_90_Points\tGenerous and creamy perlage opens the stage for deeply fragrant tones of tangerine skin, white flower and peach.

Those elements are very well integrated on the palate, where a cedar-laced frame presents lots of dark red fruit and crushed spice.\n99315\tUS\tAllen Vineyard\t95\t82\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tWilliams Selyem 2014 Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tWilliams Selyem\tGT_90_Points\tAnother longtime standout for Williams Selyem, Allen Vineyard fruit imparts textural subtleties and a wealth of minerality and freshness.

Brawny red berries and wild cherries mix with cut sagebrush, eucalyptus and crushed graphite on the nose. The palate combines bright red, acid-driven raspberry fruit with the darker structure of elderberry. Throw in thyme and bay leaf for the complete package.\n120327\tUS\t\t89\t20\tWashington\tHorse Heaven Hills\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tRobert Karl 2008 Claret (Horse Heaven Hills)\tClaret\tRobert Karl\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a delicious rendition of the annual Claret blend.

Evidence of its youth lies in the big tannins and acids and the way the fruit flavors are so fresh and primary. Although it's delicious in berries and currants, it just hasn't pulled together. It's so balanced it should benefit from 4–5 years in a cellar.\n79917\tUS\tBoushey Vineyard\t83\t21\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tCapstone Cellars 2009 Boushey Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley)\tCabernet Franc\tCapstone Cellars\tLT_90_Points\tThin and green flavors dominate this Cabernet Franc.

This is an impressive, powerful yet elegant wine. Its dark fruits are sustained by wood and leavened by acidity.

Only nine vintages have been made since 1986, a selection of a selection. Figs, superripe black plums, dense tannins, and bitter chocolate are all here.

After an opening that's tight and strained, Novas spreads out to show lime, passion fruit and green melon flavors. The feel is ripe and full, and it finishes grassy and green, with acid-driven length.

Past that is an enormously rich, dry, vibrant wine, explosive in raspberries, cherries and ripe, sweet persimmons. New French oak, with its caramel-like toastiness, is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. It's a bit disjointed now, but give it 3–4 years in the cellar, and it should come around.\n90289\tUS\tBlack Ridge Vineyards\t91\t32\tCalifornia\tSanta Cruz Mountains\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tLeft Bend 2014 Black Ridge Vineyards Viognier (Santa Cruz Mountains)\tViognier\tLeft Bend\tGT_90_Points\tDeftly showing restraint with this grape that can easily be made into overripe wine, this bottling offers clean aromas of nectarine, apple blossom, bubblegum and tropical guava cream.

A bombastically dense and concentrated wine, it's gamy, meaty and brawny all around. Black fruit, tar and tobacco combine to full-bodied effect. It would be best to wait on this one, cellaring through 2020.\n86468\tUS\tSmith Vineyard\t93\t50\tCalifornia\tSanta Lucia Highlands\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tLucienne 2013 Smith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)\tPinot Noir\tLucienne\tGT_90_Points\tSmoked beef, tart cherries and dark berries show on the inviting nose of this hearty bottling from winemaker Paul Clifton.

Like its name suggests, Terra Rossa (red earth) is bold and opulent with unrelenting aromas of dark berry, leather, spice and chocolate fudge. Toasted-oak notes fill in the background and remind you that this is a modern expression of Brunello that will appeal to those who love a soft and layered style. All that rich red fruit softens the natural acidity of the vintage.\n20470\tFrance\tThe Original Purple\t85\t15\tSouthwest France\tCahors\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tChâteau Lagrézette 2009 The Original Purple Malbec (Cahors)\tMalbec\tChâteau Lagrézette\tLT_90_Points\tThis entry-level wine from Lagrézette is certainly purple in color.

You get telling acacia and lychee aromas, but none of the cheap perfume that can sometimes ruin the variety. The palate is lightly oily but linear, while the papaya, citrus and melon flavors just roll along.\n52365\tPortugal\tReserva Tinto\t88\t20\tTejo\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tQuinta da Lapa 2012 Reserva Tinto Red (Tejo)\tPortuguese Red\tQuinta da Lapa\tLT_90_Points\tThis blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is rich and concentrated.

It's a fresh yet oaky type of Rioja, with resiny creaminess cut by lively acidity. Flavors of vanilla, plum, raspberry and tobacco are traditional, while the finish is mild, crisp and snappy.

Sour cranberry fruit leads the sip, where the herbal character is impressively pervasive, though perhaps a tad too much so.\n17428\tAustria\tHochrain Old Vines\t87\t20\tWachau\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tMachherndl 2006 Hochrain Old Vines Pinot Blanc (Wachau)\tPinot Blanc\tMachherndl\tLT_90_Points\tIt is odd to find a Pinot Blanc in the land of Grüner Veltliner and Riesling. But a block of loam soil, planted with old vines gave Erich Machherndl the idea for this wine. The concentration of the old vines produces a full, creamy wine, green-plum flavored, with some cinnamon and weight.\n58081\tUS\t\t89\t27\tOregon\tRogue Valley\tSouthern Oregon\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tJ.

It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.\n40114\tItaly\tDry\t87\t17\tVeneto\tValdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore\t\tKerin O’Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tAstoria NV Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)\tGlera\tAstoria\tLT_90_Points\tScents of yellow stone fruit and white spring flower mingle in the glass.

Drink through 2017.\n28885\tFrance\tFlower Label\t87\t20\tBeaujolais\tMorgon\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tGeorges Duboeuf 2015 Flower Label  (Morgon)\tGamay\tGeorges Duboeuf\tLT_90_Points\tWhile it misses out on the firmer side of the Morgon cru, this is a robust ripe wine. It has attractive red-cherry fruit and juicy acidity. The structure will allow it to age for a few more months, so drink from late 2017.\n124871\tUS\tCuvée Meline\t88\t27\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tLauren Ashton Cellars 2016 Cuvée Meline White (Columbia Valley (WA))\tBordeaux-style White Blend\tLauren Ashton Cellars\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine is a blend of Sémillon (55%) and Sauvignon Blanc from Cave B and Mercer Estate vineyards. Aromas are reticent at present, with notes of reduction, grass, herb and spice. The palate is flavorful, with citrus and tropical-fruit flavors. It delivers a lot of enjoyment.\n33703\tItaly\tRiserva\t91\t\tPiedmont\tBarbaresco\t\t\t\tFrancone 2006 Riserva  (Barbaresco)\tNebbiolo\tFrancone\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a beautiful wine that focuses on complexity and elegance rather than heft and power. In fact, the Riserva Barbaresco presents traditional aromas of small dried berry, cassis, cola and pressed violets that are typical of the Nebbiolo grape. The mouthfeel is tight, tannic and could use 5–10 more years of cellar aging.\n28825\tUS\tDry\t85\t14\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C.

The wine has an oaky stickiness to it that is most present late. While neither heavy nor stewed, this wine does have a soft, chunky DNA. So while it's big and plump, it's also only half-full.\n55219\tUS\tLumière\t92\t39\tOregon\tEola-Amity Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tJ. Christopher 2012 Lumière Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)\tPinot Noir\tJ. Christopher\tGT_90_Points\tPart of the winery's Terroir Series, this is aromatic with bright raspberry fruit dotted with peppery herbs.

In the mouth, this Tempranillo-led blend is rich and jammy but not out of shape. Blackberry, prune and toasty flavors finish lusty, with a touch of heat and burn that should settle in due time. Drink now through 2023.\n82144\tUS\tThe Arsonist\t91\t22\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tMatchbook 2014 The Arsonist Red (California)\tRed Blend\tMatchbook\tGT_90_Points\tThis blend of Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon incorporates wonderful, spicy oak with a ripe and generous core of black fruits to a firm texture of fine-grained tannins. It has plenty of oak character, but the oak is well integrated and complements the blackberry and blueberry flavors deftly.\n27818\tUS\t\t86\t40\tCalifornia\tCarmel Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tJoullian 2013 Merlot (Carmel Valley)\tMerlot\tJoullian\tLT_90_Points\tSharp Concord grape ripeness meets with a touch of chile pepper and dark tobacco on the nose of this bottling. The palate is redolent with aromatic woods, from cedar to sandalwood, as well as blueberries and dried herbs, but it's a tad thin.\n115804\tSpain\t\t92\t90\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlion 2004  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo Blend\tAlion\tGT_90_Points\tBig and modern is the path that Alion (owned by Vega Sicilia) follows. This vintage is excellent, the best since 2001. It offers sweet, ripe black fruit with solid but balanced tannins. Chocolate and leather give the finish sweetness and style, while the overall take is that this is a forceful but sexy wine. Best in a couple of years through 2014. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.\n115285\tUS\t\t90\t40\tCalifornia\tSanta Barbara County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tTercero 2015 Cinsault (Santa Barbara County)\tCinsault\tTercero\tGT_90_Points\tWinemaker Larry Schaffer proudly explores lesser-used varieties such as Cinsault, and makes compelling arguments in their favor. This bottling from Camp 4 Vineyard shows fresh and dried strawberry and slightly sour plum on the nose with a touch clove and dried ginger. The palate offers cranberry and hibiscus with red licorice spice, presented with lively acidity.\n121255\tUS\tBeauregard Ranch\t93\t55\tCalifornia\tBen Lomond Mountain\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tBeauregard 2014 Beauregard Ranch Chardonnay (Ben Lomond Mountain)\tChardonnay\tBeauregard\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a lightly style wine but extremely vivacious and sexy, with cut red apple, mandarin orange skin, ripe nectarine and lightly honeyed Gravenstein apple on the nose. It's clean, crisp and focused on the palate, where lime zest, limestone and a touch of buttered pear in the midpalate makes for a complete and balanced sip.\n32230\tFrance\t\t85\t32\tBurgundy\tChorey-lès-Beaune\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tHenri de Villamont 2011  Chorey-lès-Beaune\tPinot Noir\tHenri de Villamont\tLT_90_Points\tStill very young, it's full of acidity as well as bright raspberry fruits that give freshness.

It is dense enough to add layers of mineral and mocha. Tannins are powerful and smooth, with a hint of green stem and pepper.\n104646\tUS\t\t86\t30\tCalifornia\tSolano County\tNorth Coast\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tPutah Creek 2009 Syrah (Solano County)\tSyrah\tPutah Creek\tLT_90_Points\tWhile somewhat withdrawn aromatically, this Syrah has integrated flavors of cinnamon, plum and raspberry.

The wine shows good crispness, polished tannins and would pair with pasta and meat sauce.\n15511\tFrance\tAbbaye de Morgeot Premier Cru\t93\t113\tBurgundy\tChassagne-Montrachet\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tOlivier Leflaive 2012 Abbaye de Morgeot Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet)\tChardonnay\tOlivier Leflaive\tGT_90_Points\tThe wine has so much structure and tension. It is wound up and tight, full of acidity as well as the potential for rich fruits. A steely texture powers up the concentration of this wine, which has a strongly toasty component at this stage. Drink from 2018.\n25121\tUS\tGypsy Noir\t86\t27\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\t\t\tGrizzly Republic 2008 Gypsy Noir Red (Paso Robles)\tRhône-style Red Blend\tGrizzly Republic\tLT_90_Points\tA blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and other varieties, this is a standard-issue red wine, soft and a little sweet, with pie-filling flavors of cherries and raspberries. It's light and spicy on the finish.\n100361\tAustria\tKäferberg Reserve\t92\t50\tKamptal\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl MW\t@AnneInVino\tJurtschitsch 2015 Käferberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)\tGrüner Veltliner\tJurtschitsch\tGT_90_Points\tSoftly perfumed stone fruits like ripe mirabelles shimmer in the glass and are supported on the palate with a zingy backbone of freshness. This is a wonderful union of ripe fruit flavors and exhilarating freshness. There is concentration at the core and a long whistle-clean finish.\n60914\tNew Zealand\tCornish Point\t91\t65\tCentral Otago\t\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFelton Road 2008 Cornish Point Pinot Noir (Central Otago)\tPinot Noir\tFelton Road\tGT_90_Points\tSupple but structured, this is only the third vintage for Felton Road's Cornish Point Pinot and it is really starting to hit its stride. Touches of hickory smoke and mocha accent the dark plum and savory fruit, finishing long, spicy and with a note of brown-sugar sweetness.\n34530\tUS\tReserve\t83\t25\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tHogue 2008 Reserve Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)\tChardonnay\tHogue\tLT_90_Points\tPerhaps an unrepresentative bottle (just one was submitted), but this 2008 reserve was muddy in the glass and flabby in the mouth. Oaky and buttery to an extreme degree, it had lost all freshness and fruit.\n71372\tChile\tKalfu Kuda\t88\t19\tLeyda Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVentisquero 2015 Kalfu Kuda Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tVentisquero\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of nettle and cactus pad are briny and typical of Leyda SB. This is full in body for Sauvignon Blanc, but balanced by needle-like acidity. Flavors follow the nose, meaning nettle, briny citrus and bell pepper. A long finish is sharp but balanced.\n29530\tFrance\t\t84\t19\tBurgundy\tBourgogne\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tPierre Gruber 2014  Bourgogne\tPinot Noir\tPierre Gruber\tLT_90_Points\tThis light-colored wine is attractively perfumed but with a grassy edge that suggests the fruit was underripe.

With a fine tang and shot of acidity, it is developing well, but needs more time.

The warm, robust palate offers dried black cherry marinated in spirits, raisin, licorice and espresso alongside dusty tannins that dry out the finish. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's already evolved, with evident alcohol that throws it off-balance.\n114974\tPortugal\tCapela Vintage\t98\t127\tPort\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tQuinta do Vesuvio 2011 Capela Vintage  (Port)\tPort\tQuinta do Vesuvio\tGT_90_Points\tThis is beautifully ripe and perfumed, packed with richness in the form of sweet berries and touches of spice. It's already a gorgeous wine, its ripeness lifted by the acidity and given shape by the tannic structure. This powerful wine shows great aging potential.\n87885\tItaly\tPegrandi\t88\t18\tVeneto\tValpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso\t\t\t\tVaona 2010 Pegrandi  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)\tCorvina, Rondinella, Molinara\tVaona\tLT_90_Points\tThickly textured and dense, this has plenty of ripe fruit, tobacco, cola and anise-like aromas. It has the power to cut through cooked beans, and it would pair nicely with a heaping serving of barley, bacon and legume soup.\n61184\tSpain\tFino Una Palma\t90\t34\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGonzález Byass NV Fino Una Palma Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tGonzález Byass\tGT_90_Points\tPine resin and a light, oily brine character define the nose on this lithe, fresh fino. Crisp acidity and healthy weight mesh into balance on an easy-to-navigate palate. Flavors of almond, sea brine and toffee finish crisp.\n62998\tUS\t\t88\t13\tCalifornia\tEdna Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tTangent 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Edna Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tTangent\tLT_90_Points\tShows the brilliantly etched fruit and brisk acidity that mark an Edna Valley white wine. Tremendous in citrus and wintergreen flavors, its mouth-cleansing quality makes it ideal for an appetizer.

It feels lush, thick and chewy, with ripe, dense berry flavors that come with plenty of young oak. Creamy in feel, it features vanilla and resin flavors on the finish. Modern and chunky in style.\n101300\tPortugal\tTerraços do Tejo\t83\t\tTejo\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCasal da Coelheira 2011 Terraços do Tejo Red (Tejo)\tPortuguese Red\tCasal da Coelheira\tLT_90_Points\tThis is an earthy wine with barnyard flavors.

A beautiful bouquet of tuberose and honey warns that the sipping experience may border on cloying. Though not a good fit for those who demand a thoroughly dry Gewürztraminer, this isn't a sugar bomb by any means, with flavors of honeydew melon, orange blossom and bubble gum.\n79728\tUS\t\t89\t28\tOregon\tRogue Valley\tSouthern Oregon\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tSilvan Ridge 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tSilvan Ridge\tLT_90_Points\tFairly aromatic, it conveys notes of red and black fruit, savory herbs, toffee and barrel spices.

Aromas of grilled fruit mesh beautifully with toasted whole grain on the nose, while similar flavors swirl endlessly in the mouth. Yet despite being warm and welcoming, full bodied and broad on the palate, it's refreshingly firm on the lengthy finish. Drink now–2016.\n126198\tUS\tClone 115\t88\t55\tCalifornia\tSta.

Rita Hills)\tPinot Noir\tFess Parker\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a big, dense Pinot Noir, and quite a good one, although it's a bit sharp in acidity. Really packs in the black cherry and oak flavors, with a long, red licorice finish, but it's immature, and needs time to come together. Give it 2–3 years.\n88877\tUS\tVineyard 2131\t94\t80\tCalifornia\tDiamond Mountain District\tNapa\t\t\tVon Strasser 2009 Vineyard 2131 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tVon Strasser\tGT_90_Points\tVery pure in blackberries and black currants, this expresses the classic taste of Cabernet Sauvignon. New oak adds a lovely veneer of smoky, cedary cigar box. It's beautiful to drink now for the soft, velvety texture and appealingly sweet complexity, but should age gradually for many years.\n9942\tUS\t\t90\t18\tCalifornia\tAnderson Valley\t\t\t\tHandley 2006 Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley)\tGewürztraminer\tHandley\tGT_90_Points\tSo rich, so honeyed, with an oily texture, this Gewurz is simply wonderful.

It's a classic blend of Douro grapes with the addition of Sousão (apparent from the dark color and high acidity). It's a wine that would be worth aging a few months, so wait until late 2016 to drink.\n109281\tGermany\tBernkasteler Lay Kabinett\t91\t28\tMosel\t\t\tAnna Lee C.

But experience shows that cellaring rewards. When the tannins fall out, the sweet, juicy blackberry and cherry flavors can do their thing. This beautiful Bordeaux-style Cab will be best between 2009–2013.\n21608\tUS\t\t91\t22\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tKale 2013 Rosé (Napa Valley)\tRosé\tKale\tGT_90_Points\tMade from a blend of 62% Grenache and 38% Syrah, this is a classically dry, refreshingly crisp rosé, pink-salmon in color that's intense yet soft, crafted in a Provence style.

It tastes crisp, dry, medium-bodied and well balanced.\n102311\tUS\tLes Collines Vineyard\t88\t34\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

Forest floor and earth tones burst on the palate, followed by brambly dark berry fruit, the texture soft to the finish, which offers some grip.\n117533\tAustralia\tThe Lodge Hill Dry\t90\t18\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJim Barry 2011 The Lodge Hill Dry Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tJim Barry\tGT_90_Points\tWet stone and lemon-lime.

This wine delivers both the sweetness and ripeness that it should along with some rugged, spicy edges. The finish is big and packed with licorice, spice and pepper. A fine wine. Hold until 2006.\n7360\tUS\tBunch Select Late Harvest\t88\t34\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tHeron Hill 2010 Bunch Select Late Harvest Riesling (Finger Lakes)\tRiesling\tHeron Hill\tLT_90_Points\tHoney and almond notes lend a nutty earthiness to lifted citrus aromas.

It's full of crushed limestone and soda scents and is dry on the palate, which is more about structure and texture than overt flavors.\n67678\tSpain\tAlone\t85\t11\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBocopa 2015 Alone Rosé (Alicante)\tRosé\tBocopa\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of field brush and citrus are a touch funky.

A fermentation in open lagars as well as time in oak give this blend richness and a deliciously juicy. Ripe and full bodied, it is ready to drink.\n58679\tItaly\tRiva Rocca\t89\t70\tPiedmont\tBarolo\t\tKerin O’Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tClaudio Alario 2012 Riva Rocca  (Barolo)\tNebbiolo\tClaudio Alario\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of oak, coffee, rose, chopped mint and licorice take shape in the glass while the tight palate offers toast, espresso, raspberry jam and a confectionary note. Firm tannins grip the finish.\n59182\tItaly\t\t88\t20\tPiedmont\tBarbera d'Asti\t\tKerin O’Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tCaldera 2011  Barbera d'Asti\tBarbera\tCaldera\tLT_90_Points\tThis structured Barbera offers aromas of ripe cherry, raspberry and plum with light toasted notes. The palate delivers a tight core of black cherry with black pepper and licorice, layered with a hint of espresso. This still needs a year or two to fully unwind, so it's best after 2015.\n97504\tItaly\tLenaia Rosso\t88\t\tTuscany\tToscana\t\t\t\tCasa di Terra 2009 Lenaia Rosso Red (Toscana)\tRed Blend\tCasa di Terra\tLT_90_Points\tHere's one of those fresh, bright Italian wines you'll want to pair with home cooked pasta or lasagna. The delivery is direct and fresh with lingering tones of cherry, root beer, licorice and sweet forest berry. The mouthfeel is clean, polished and crisp.\n45322\tItaly\t\t88\t16\tPiedmont\tBarbera d'Asti\t\tKerin O’Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tPodere dei Brichhi Astigiani 2015  Barbera d'Asti\tBarbera\tPodere dei Brichhi Astigiani\tLT_90_Points\tThis has violet, black-skinned berry and herb aromas.

Enjoy through 2020.\n128460\tGermany\tKaseler Nies'chen Trocken GG\t88\t49\tMosel\t\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tReichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2009 Kaseler Nies'chen Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel)\tRiesling\tReichsgraf von Kesselstatt\tLT_90_Points\tThe von Kesselstatt estate released four GG bottlings in 2009, and this wine was perhaps the least of them. It's very good nonetheless, with fresh, slightly floral aromas and bold flavors of baked apple and orange zest. There's a chunkiness in the mouth and a slight coarseness of texture compared to the others, but that's splitting hairs.\n117601\tItaly\tPertimali\t94\t55\tTuscany\tBrunello di Montalcino\t\tKerin O’Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tLivio Sassetti 2011 Pertimali  (Brunello di Montalcino)\tSangiovese\tLivio Sassetti\tGT_90_Points\tFloral and refined, this opens with alluring scents of violet, iris, perfumed berry, earth and a whiff of pressed powder. The savory, elegant palate offers up juicy wild cherry, raspberry, truffle, anise and white pepper framed in a network of silky tannins. It's already extremely accessible and will offer fine drinking pleasure for the near and mid-term.\n112660\tUS\t\t84\t20\tOregon\tRogue Valley\tSouthern Oregon\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tDel Rio 2007 Viognier (Rogue Valley)\tViognier\tDel Rio\tLT_90_Points\tThis smells— and remarkably it also tastes—like bubble gum, with some pineapple tossed in for good measure. Peaches and apricots? Not so much; this is definitely an atypical Viognier, but brings plenty of candied fruit to the table.\n31077\tItaly\t\t86\t16\tTuscany\tToscana\t\t\t\tVilla Pillo 2005 Syrah (Toscana)\tSyrah\tVilla Pillo\tLT_90_Points\tThis performed unevenly depending on the bottle.

The wine is 100% varietal. Shows promise, but needs greater concentration, even if the price has to be higher.\n112900\tUS\tReserve\t86\t30\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tLakewood 2010 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)\tCabernet Franc\tLakewood\tLT_90_Points\tAt 15.9% abv, this is a monster by Finger Lakes standards, but it's unsurprising perhaps for such a hot vintage. A tad jammy on the palate, it's sweet with red cherry fruit that's framed by herbaceous green notes and layers of soft, furry tannins.\n67164\tUS\t\t88\t28\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tStottle 2013 Merlot (Yakima Valley)\tMerlot\tStottle\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine's aromas are quite generous, suggesting herbs, vanilla, baking spice and purple fruit. Its cranberry and cherry flavors are both tart and ripe, supported by soft tannins and a lingering café au lait note. The oak influence gets in the way of the fruit at times, but it's pleasant all the same.\n10876\tPortugal\tVintage\t91\t\tPort\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tAndresen 2011 Vintage  (Port)\tPort\tAndresen\tGT_90_Points\tFull-bodied and smoky, this is a ripely fruity wine. The berry fruit is dominant, providing structure as well as richness. Strong spice and dark wood characters bring out the fruitiness of the wine, while the tannins come later.\n47461\tFrance\tCollection\t89\t20\tAlsace\tAlsace\t\tAnne Krebiehl MW\t@AnneInVino\tCave de Ribeauvillé 2015 Collection Riesling (Alsace)\tRiesling\tCave de Ribeauvillé\tLT_90_Points\tSoft and mellow ripeness rises from the glass, suggesting ripe Mirabelle plum and warm citrus. The palate of this wine is bright with lemony, high-pitched freshness balanced by the dry, fruit-driven body and clean finish.\n33794\tNew Zealand\tCoddington\t93\t46\tKumeu\t\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKumeu River 2015 Coddington Chardonnay (Kumeu)\tChardonnay\tKumeu River\tGT_90_Points\tUsually the bigger, more opulent of the Kumeu River Chardonnays, the 2015 version of the Coddington is medium to full in weight, but strikingly focused and vibrant. Bacony smoke notes frame white peach flavors, finishing long.\n36111\tGermany\t\t89\t11\tMosel\t\t\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tMember's Mark 2016 Riesling (Mosel)\tRiesling\tMember's Mark\tLT_90_Points\tFor a value-priced wine (especially considering its large-format bottling), this unassuming Riesling offers a bounty of juicy, fruity enjoyment calibrated with hints of minerality and revitalizing freshness. Its semidry tangerine and apricot flavors are easygoing yet zesty, slicked in honey and a touch of graphite. The finish is brisk but clean. Drink now.\n107599\tItaly\tVigna Monte Danieli\t92\t70\tVeneto\tAmarone della Valpolicella Classico\t\t\t\tCorte Rugolin 2003 Vigna Monte Danieli  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)\tCorvina, Rondinella, Molinara\tCorte Rugolin\tGT_90_Points\tThis Amarone is made in a traditional style with aromas of forest berry, red apple, spice and barbecue smoke. It exhibits pretty luminosity and buoyancy with vibrant fruit flavors and a fresh cherry finale. Very nice.\n84657\tUS\t\t88\t38\tCalifornia\tAlexander Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tDashe Cellars 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tDashe Cellars\tLT_90_Points\tFruit and spice star in this bone-dry Cabernet. It's very forward in blackberries, cherries, currants and dark chocolate, while the spice shows in the form of pepper, clove and star anise. The tannins are quite strong and rasping, and may never fully resolve. Give it 3–5 years in the cellar.\n61024\tAustralia\tEmeri Sparkling Pinot Grigio\t84\t10\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDe Bortoli NV Emeri Sparkling Pinot Grigio Sparkling (South Eastern Australia)\tSparkling Blend\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tComes across as a bit sweet and soft, with tropical fruit and a lush, creamy texture. Clean and well made, but lacks complexity and length.\n51551\tSpain\tFurvus\t90\t34\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVinyes Doménech 2007 Furvus Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tVinyes Doménech\tGT_90_Points\tDeep, ripe, pure black fruit aromas feature leather and oak accents. The palate has a nice feel and good balance; it's tight, minerally and deals toasty berry, snappy pomegranate and chocolaty spice. Tight as a drum and long on the finish. Drinkable now but better down the road. 65% Garnacha with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.\n81692\tItaly\tUceline\t88\t29\tPiedmont\tMonferrato\t\tKerin O’Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tCascina Castlet 2011 Uceline Uvalino (Monferrato)\tUvalino\tCascina Castlet\tLT_90_Points\tMade entirely with rare native grape Uvalino, this opens with aromas that recall ripe black plum and vanilla.

Enjoy through 2018.\n124179\tFrance\tLe Bourg\t90\t33\tBurgundy\tPouilly-Loché\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tMarcel Couturier 2014 Le Bourg  (Pouilly-Loché)\tChardonnay\tMarcel Couturier\tGT_90_Points\tAttractive spice and toast aromas add richness to this wine. They lie over the ripe white-stone-fruit flavors that are freshened by citrus. It is still too young to be fully integrated, so wait until 2017 to drink this wine.\n14848\tChile\tSingle Vineyard Cahuil\t88\t22\tLeyda Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLeyda 2013 Single Vineyard Cahuil Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley)\tPinot Noir\tLeyda\tLT_90_Points\tRoasted plum and savory meat aromas are more earthy than bright. Creamy and a touch sticky in feel, this deals flavors that follow the nose, including baked plum, pepper and savory notes. On the finish, it's oak and peppery spice in the lead.\n6703\tUS\tBechthold Vineyard\t91\t29\tCalifornia\tLodi\tCentral Valley\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tOnesta 2012 Bechthold Vineyard Cinsault (Lodi)\tCinsault\tOnesta\tGT_90_Points\tJammy aromas and concentrated grape and blackberry flavors pack a lot of fruitiness into this full-bodied and velvet-textured wine. The ripe and almost sweet berry and plum notes gush forth with gusto while the firm, grippy texture keeps the mouthfeel nicely dry and helps clear the palate for the next bite or sip.\n48519\tUS\t\t92\t65\tCalifornia\tGreen Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tLa Crema 2013 Pinot Noir (Green Valley)\tPinot Noir\tLa Crema\tGT_90_Points\tThe producer expertly captures the mix of coolness and intensity so true to the appellation, a tangle of brooding black cherry, blackberry and underlying smoke, that's both decadent and succulent on the palate, deeply satisfying in its finish of chocolate and black licorice.\n46107\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t93\t77\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tProtos 2011 Gran Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tProtos\tGT_90_Points\tFull-throttle oak, vanilla, tobacco and smoky blackberry aromas feed into a full, grippy but surprisingly fresh palate.

Drink this excellent Tempranillo from a powerful vintage through 2025.\n52918\tUS\tNielson Vineyard\t92\t40\tCalifornia\tSanta Maria Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tNielson by Byron 2012 Nielson Vineyard G-S-M (Santa Maria Valley)\tG-S-M\tNielson by Byron\tGT_90_Points\tVery dark in the glass, this inky wine shows aromas of iodine, distilled violets and wound-up black-currant fruit, making the Syrah appear in charge. It's very dense but not especially ripe on the sip, where layered tannins reluctantly reveal elderberry and lilac flavors. Though five years old, it still needs time to unwind.\n104625\tUS\t\t86\t11\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\t\t\t7 Peaks 2012 Pinot Noir (California)\tPinot Noir\t7 Peaks\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a nice value for Pinot Noir. It has some real richness of fruit and smoothness of texture.

Its aromas and flavors conjure up the wild mountain scenery around the vineyard, giving black fruits, dense tannins and acidity. The spice at the end is another reminder of its origins. Drink from 2017.\n22429\tAustralia\tBin 28 Kalimna\t88\t26\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenfolds 2006 Bin 28 Kalimna Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tPenfolds\tLT_90_Points\tNamed for the famous Shiraz-growing district at the north end of the Barossa Valley, Penfolds' Kalimna Shiraz is in fact a multiregional South Australian blend that aims to recreate the Kalimna style.

Drink now.\n7431\tAustralia\tTintara\t86\t15\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\t\t\tHardys 2001 Tintara Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tHardys\tLT_90_Points\tA well-balanced and straightforward wine, the Tintara is medium-bodied and creamy in the mouth, with stone fruit and vanilla flavors. Butterscotch, and maybe some nuttiness, wraps it up on the finish.\n27586\tAustralia\tLanghorne Crossing LX Verdelho-Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay\t81\t12\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBleasdale 2015 Langhorne Crossing LX Verdelho-Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay White (Langhorne Creek)\tWhite Blend\tBleasdale\tLT_90_Points\tThe offbeat, savory nose is certainly complex, and the flavors follow in a similar vein, showing hints of onion and soft-ripened cheese. It's light in body, with a touch of residual sugar and a short finish.\n80876\tAustralia\t\t87\t15\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tFox Creek 2002 Chardonnay (South Australia)\tChardonnay\tFox Creek\tLT_90_Points\tRefreshing and straightforward, with crisp white peach flavors on the palate. Nose offers floral, vanilla and citrus notes; finish offers a dash of mint or eucalyptus. There's toast here from start to finish, but it's subtle.\n77415\tAustralia\tThe Reserve\t87\t11\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\t\t\tYellow Tail 2007 The Reserve Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)\tShiraz\tYellow Tail\tLT_90_Points\tRipe and generous, this is another good value in Yellowtail's reserve line. Boysenberry, blueberry and delicate licorice scents work the nose, followed by sweet raspberry flavors in the mouth. Oak-derived coconut aromas seem to sit on top of the wine but may integrate better after a year in bottle.\n25718\tAustralia\tEmeri Sparkling Sauvignon Blanc\t84\t13\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDe Bortoli NV Emeri Sparkling Sauvignon Blanc Sparkling (South Eastern Australia)\tSparkling Blend\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tSoft and creamy in style, with aromas and flavors of pineapple and ginger.

It's round in the mouth and lushly textured, then turns citrusy—almost metallic—on the finish.\n106985\tAustralia\tEastside\t91\t28\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPikes 2007 Eastside Shiraz (Clare Valley)\tShiraz\tPikes\tGT_90_Points\tLush and creamy on the palate, this complex wine boasts flavors of slightly mossy, decaying cedar, molasses, damp earth and leather, all wrapped around a bright core of red berry. Supple and lasting on the finish. Drink now–2020.\n101408\tAustralia\tCalliope Limited Release\t88\t35\tVictoria\tRutherglen\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tR.L. Buller & Son 2004 Calliope Limited Release Durif (Rutherglen)\tDurif\tR.L. Buller & Son\tLT_90_Points\tDespite substantial alcohol (16.5%), this admirably concentrated wine doesn't show that much heat, nor does it show any roasted, cooked character. Instead, it delivers black olive, leather and cassis flavors just tinged with mint and a fresh, lively finish hinting at coffee. The tannins are soft but present, helping to balance a hint of residual sugar. Drink now–2012.\n62050\tAustralia\tHarry's Monster\t89\t30\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGiant Steps 2006 Harry's Monster Red (Yarra Valley)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tGiant Steps\tLT_90_Points\tYou might not know it from this wine's rather austere exterior, but this is actually from a warm site within the cool Yarra Valley. It's a restrained, slightly herbal blend of 62% Cabernet, 27% Merlot and 11% Petit Verdot that finishes with a tough mouthful of tannin. Hold it for another 3–4 years and hope that the fruit holds up.\n59984\tAustralia\tOne\t95\t95\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHeartland 2013 One Red (Langhorne Creek)\tRed Blend\tHeartland\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a throwback to those brash, flavor-exuding Aussie wines of the past. Flashy, sweet-scented oak (think maple syrup and toasted coconut) marks the nose, while concentrated cassis and vanilla flavors coat the palate. This is big, but gorgeously so, with velvety-rich tannins and a long, plush finish. No, there's nothing subtle about this blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Shiraz, but sometimes subtlety is overrated. Drink now–2030.\n17776\tAustralia\tTitan\t92\t28\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAlpha Crucis 2014 Titan Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tAlpha Crucis\tGT_90_Points\tWhile the trend among many Australian Cabernets is towards moderate, silky tannin structures, this austere, firm wine embraces its dry, dusty nature. Cedar and toast frame big cassis fruit, ending with chewy tannins. Drink 2018–2028.\n48812\tAustralia\tTwo Steps\t91\t17\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWest Cape Howe 2009 Two Steps Shiraz (Western Australia)\tShiraz\tWest Cape Howe\tGT_90_Points\tSourced from Mount Barker, this is a full-bodied, supple example of WA Shiraz. Concentrated plummy fruit is marked by hints of menthol and peppery spice, then ends in a soft wash of dusty tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink now–2020+.\n107570\tAustralia\tThe Phantom\t88\t20\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGemtree 2008 The Phantom Petit Verdot (McLaren Vale)\tPetit Verdot\tGemtree\tLT_90_Points\tPetit Verdot is a character actor who's never really grabbed the spotlight for itself, but makes an interesting appearance now and again. This McLaren Vale example is oaky but backed by ample plum and cassis fruit and framed by tannins that seem soft for the variety. Cedar and spice come through on the finish. Drink now.\n78399\tAustralia\tLights Out\t90\t20\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRoss Estate 2009 Lights Out Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tRoss Estate\tGT_90_Points\tSure, this wine is full bodied and lush, filled with ripe raspberry fruit, but there is also a sense of underlying structure, and some lovely herb-spice complexities, like rhubarb, cedar, cinnamon, vanilla and cracked pepper. Drink it over the next 2–3 years.\n13456\tAustralia\tOomoo\t90\t15\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHardys 2004 Oomoo Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tHardys\tGT_90_Points\tAn excellent value, Hardys' Oomoo Shiraz can run with a pack twice its price, offering earth and cola aromas and a deep undercurrent of blackberries. It's full-bodied, mouthfilling yet structured. Adds flavors of black olives to the mix, along with velvety tannins and mouthwatering acids on the finish.\n64690\tAustralia\tStone Cutting No Oak\t87\t20\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPauletts 2009 Stone Cutting No Oak Chardonnay (Clare Valley)\tChardonnay\tPauletts\tLT_90_Points\tA lean, crisp style of Chardonnay, with citrusy flavors and a touch of honeyed development.

That swirl of seeming contradictions continues on the palate, backed by luxurious, supple tannins that linger softly on the finish. Drink now–2025.\n100264\tAustralia\t1919\t93\t100\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCasella 2006 1919 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCasella\tGT_90_Points\tDespite reaching its eighth birthday, this is still an incredibly youthful vibrant purple color, with no signs of aging. Aromas and flavors of smoke, toast, black olive, vanilla and cassis are what you might expect from a much younger wine. The tannins are firm, yet the wine is fleshy enough to carry them into a long finish. Drink 2018–2025.\n813\tAustralia\tCuvee Juveniles\t90\t22\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2013 Cuvee Juveniles Red (Barossa Valley)\tRed Blend\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tBuilt for early consumption, this blend of 59% Grenache, 22% Shiraz and 19% Mataro is lush and warm, offering chocolaty notes alongside hints of brown sugar, grilled meat and blueberries.

The 2009 is a full-bodied,  creamy-textured example, with flavors of cherries jubilee grounded by savory, meaty notes. A long, mouth-coating finish completes the picture. Drink now–2018.\n2312\tAustralia\t\t90\t33\tWestern Australia\tPemberton\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPicardy 2006 Chardonnay (Pemberton)\tChardonnay\tPicardy\tGT_90_Points\tFrom a little-known region of Western Australia, this is a restrained, structured example of Chardonnay that may drink well for 5–6 years. Subtle vanilla and bacon shadings upfront add nuance to the melon and pear aromas. Flavors are of soft, fully ripe tree fruit and melon, but held in check by citrusy notes and crisp acids.\n35351\tAustralia\tBasket Pressed\t92\t40\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKay Brothers 2013 Basket Pressed Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tKay Brothers\tGT_90_Points\tDark and savory in style, this Shiraz offers scents of grilled meat, black olive and plum. It's full bodied and firmly structured, finishing on a crisp peppery note. It should drink well from 2020 to 2030.\n97892\tAustralia\tReserve\t85\t13\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJacob's Creek 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tJacob's Creek\tLT_90_Points\tMore austere and lighter in weight than other Australian Cabernets in this price range, perhaps reflecting its coolish Coonawarra origins. Herb and cherry notes finish dusty and crisp. Might surprise in a year or two.\n85443\tAustralia\tPresidents Selection\t88\t14\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWolf Blass 2005 Presidents Selection Chardonnay (South Australia)\tChardonnay\tWolf Blass\tLT_90_Points\tIt's full-bodied and a little warm (14% alcohol), but this also boasts baked apple and citrus fruit and restrained, pencilly, toasty oak. It's lush and mouthfilling without being overblown; rich without being exotic—a well made New World Chard.\n50828\tAustralia\tPoison Hill Vineyard\t85\t18\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\t\t\tFrankland Estate 2002 Poison Hill Vineyard Riesling (Western Australia)\tRiesling\tFrankland Estate\tLT_90_Points\tA straight-ahead Riesling, pleasant but uncomplicated. Minerals envelop white stone fruit on the palate; the fruit is more fruit skin than flesh. Nose is light and feminine, with citrus and confectioners' sugar notes.\n116326\tAustralia\tThe Ripper!\t87\t15\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHope Estate 2005 The Ripper! Shiraz (Western Australia)\tShiraz\tHope Estate\tLT_90_Points\tA nicely balanced red. It's not the richest, deepest wine out there, but it does offer plenty of red plum and raspberry flavors, framed by vanilla-scented oak. It's reasonably long on the finish, too, where the wine picks up attractive cedary accents.\n90504\tAustralia\tSt Kitts Vineyard on Truro Volcanic Soil\t90\t30\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tThorn Clarke 2008 St Kitts Vineyard on Truro Volcanic Soil Malbec (Barossa Valley)\tMalbec\tThorn Clarke\tGT_90_Points\tA dark, inky purple in color, this is a full-bodied (15.5% alcohol) but gentle Malbec, its vanilla, plum and black olive notes framed by supple tannins and a velvety finish. Drink it over the next several years.\n83968\tAustralia\t\t87\t18\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tT'Gallant 2000 Chardonnay (Mornington Peninsula)\tChardonnay\tT'Gallant\tLT_90_Points\tSeems almost Burgundian in this crowd, with its aromas of smoke and white peach and flavors of roasted hazelnuts and grilled peaches. Finishes clean and crisp, with tart, lime-like acidity and hints of smoke.\n84575\tAustralia\tTitan\t89\t29\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAlpha Crucis 2012 Titan Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tAlpha Crucis\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine's full-bodied nature and chunky-blocky texture matches its name. It's dark and brooding in style, with hints of charred meat, asphalt and black olive. Give it some time. Drink 2018–2022.\n100796\tAustralia\tJaraman\t89\t25\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley-Eden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWakefield 2012 Jaraman Riesling (Clare Valley-Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tWakefield\tLT_90_Points\tThis Riesling shows a bit of honeyed development already, hinting at orange or tangerine marmalade on the slightly abbreviated finish. Enjoy it over the next few years.\n27428\tAustralia\t\t91\t29\tWestern Australia\tMount Barker\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPlantagenet 2009 Shiraz (Mount Barker)\tShiraz\tPlantagenet\tGT_90_Points\tDarker, sterner and less accessible than Plantagenet's Omrah bottling, the winery's flagship Shiraz offers substantial dark fruit flavors reminiscent of espresso, plum and cracked pepper. The tannins are firm, suggesting at least 2–3 years of cellaring. (The 2007 is drinking well now.)\n35183\tAustralia\t\t90\t23\tVictoria\tNagambie Lakes\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTahbilk 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Nagambie Lakes)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tTahbilk\tGT_90_Points\tA restrained, medium-weight Cabernet, the 2010 from this historic property boasts herb-tinged notes of cassis, brown sugar and hickory smoke.

It's ripe without being over the top, marrying ripeness and supple tannins with savory notes of tar and espresso. Drink now–2025, possibly beyond.\n31816\tAustralia\t\t90\t25\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\t\t\tBird in Hand 2015 Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tBird in Hand\tGT_90_Points\tGive this wine a few minutes to open up, and once it does it's a lovely example of cool climate Chardonnay. Subtle notes of ripe lemon, stone fruit, butter, and smoke lead into a slippery textured, medium-weighted palate. More lemon and stone fruit mark the flavors, and toast and smoke show on the finish.\n37036\tAustralia\tYellow Hammer Hill\t92\t25\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWild Duck Creek Estate 2008 Yellow Hammer Hill Shiraz-Malbec (Heathcote)\tShiraz-Malbec\tWild Duck Creek Estate\tGT_90_Points\tAlthough this probably won't be easy to locate (only 64 of the 550 cases produced were imported to the U.S.), it is worth seeking out for its full, expansive mouthfeel; intense cassis and dark chocolate flavors; and long, velvety finish. Drink now–2025.\n50832\tAustralia\t\t85\t18\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\t\t\tSimon Hackett 2001 Chardonnay (Barossa Valley)\tChardonnay\tSimon Hackett\tLT_90_Points\tA flavorful Chardonnay, with a backbone of ripe, tropcial fruit and apples. Toast and caramel notes sing loudly, though, from beginning to end (the wine was aged in French and American oak hogsheads)—steer clear if you're averse to wood.\n50505\tAustralia\tOld Block\t88\t70\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSt Hallett 2004 Old Block Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tSt Hallett\tLT_90_Points\tThe combination of high alcohol and ripe fruit gives this wine a sweet-seeming profile dominated by plums and blackberries, but there's also a note reminscent of alfalfa or sweet hay. Ripe tannins impart a lush, creamy mouthfeel that extends through the finish.\n106724\tAustralia\tGeneration Series Mrs.\t90\t29\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMr. Riggs 2013 Generation Series Mrs. Viognier (Adelaide)\tViognier\tMr. Riggs\tGT_90_Points\tThis is less opulent and full bodied than most Australian Viogniers, but it still delivers an attractive blend of white peaches, citrus and baking spices. It's crisp and bright enough on the finish to handle a wide range of seafood dishes. Drink now.\n116353\tAustralia\tPolish Hill River\t85\t\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPauletts 2010 Polish Hill River Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tPauletts\tLT_90_Points\tHas typical Clare Valley Riesling elements of crushed stone and citrus, but also considerable petrol and hints of honey and ripe apple. It's medium-bodied and tart, with a metallic or slightly pithy note on the finish.\n69885\tAustralia\tChockstone\t87\t22\tVictoria\tGrampians\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tA.T. Richardson 2007 Chockstone Shiraz (Grampians)\tShiraz\tA.T. Richardson\tLT_90_Points\tA solid effort, the 2007 Chockstone is a balanced, accessible red. There's ample cherry fruit, touches of cedar, vanilla and woodspice and modest tannins. Everything is in proportion, and it should drink well for the next 5-8 years.\n106426\tAustralia\tClassic Clare\t86\t45\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeasingham 2005 Classic Clare Shiraz (Clare Valley)\tShiraz\tLeasingham\tLT_90_Points\tStraightforward Australian Shiraz, combining mulberry fruit with vanilla oak. It lacks richness and expansiveness on the palate. A solid effort, but a bit of a disappointment given the history of the label and the suggested pricing.\n84046\tAustralia\tSpringvale\t90\t38\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGrosset 2008 Springvale Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tGrosset\tGT_90_Points\tLike some of the other 2008s, this wine seems to be evolving rapidly—a common enough occurence in hot vintages. Apple and citrus flavors still dominate, but the wine is already showing hints of honey and toast. Drink it now and over the next 3–5 years.\n64577\tAustralia\tAss Kisser Fine Red Wine\t87\t10\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRocland Estate 2005 Ass Kisser Fine Red Wine Red (South Australia)\tRhône-style Red Blend\tRocland Estate\tLT_90_Points\tThe blend is 59% Shiraz, 41% Grenache in this medium-bodied, low-tannin red. The aromas are dark—black cherry and plum—but the flavors are redder and juicier, with raspberry notes backed by cinnamon and clove. The label may be a bit polarizing, but the wine inside is well made and a solid value.\n58555\tAustralia\t\t85\t13\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKono Barú 2005 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)\tShiraz\tKono Barú\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a clean and fruity Shiraz—and one that fits the Australian success formula almost predictably. Jammy blackberry and cassis fruit is framed by touches of oak-derived vanilla and spice, tannins are soft and the mouthfeel supple. It's well done, even if it lacks a certain degree of individuality.\n102000\tAustralia\t\t84\t20\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWest Cape Howe 2007 Pinot Noir (Western Australia)\tPinot Noir\tWest Cape Howe\tLT_90_Points\tDominated by the menthol and cedar notes of oak, this medium-bodied Pinot features a modicum of cherry fruit and a tart, crisp finish.\n88844\tAustralia\tSparkling Kosher\t84\t15\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTeal Lake 2008 Sparkling Kosher Muscat (South Eastern Australia)\tMuscat\tTeal Lake\tLT_90_Points\tSlightly grassy and pungent on the nose, but this sweet, fizzy Muscat turns more charming on the palate, where hints of pineapple and underripe citrus help to balance out the considerable sugar. Finishes fresh and soft at the same time. Drink now.\n71033\tAustralia\t\t86\t12\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\t\t\tMcWilliam's Hanwood Estate 2006 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)\tChardonnay\tMcWilliam's Hanwood Estate\tLT_90_Points\tWith its warm and fuzzy nose of vanilla, buttered toast and freshly cut apples, this is a wine that's easy to like. The moderately intense palate shows some candied orange peel notes and fades to a moderate finish infused with lemon balm.\n126685\tAustralia\t\t85\t13\tNew South Wales\tOrange\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tClimbing 2006 Merlot (Orange)\tMerlot\tClimbing\tLT_90_Points\tThis Merlot is so gently extracted it's almost Pinot Noir-like, with delicate cherry and beet aromas and a noticeable herbal tinge to the dark cherry fruit.\n125012\tAustralia\t\t89\t17\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWakefield 2014 Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills)\tPinot Noir\tWakefield\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a toasty oaky version of Pinot Noir, loaded with cedar, vanilla and wood-derived tannins. Yet there's enough cherry fruit to provide ample support, and delicate herbal shadings peer through on the bright, concentrated finish. Drink now through 2020.\n19077\tAustralia\t\t91\t22\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSchild Estate 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tSchild Estate\tGT_90_Points\tDespite being full bodied, this is a very drinkable example of Barossa Cabernet. It's not very tannic, but instead offers mouthwatering suppleness. Cherry and red currant fruit notes are underscored by mocha shadings.\n121650\tAustralia\t\t87\t17\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRobert Oatley 2012 Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tRobert Oatley\tLT_90_Points\tThis simple, fruity Chardonnay delivers ample pear, melon and peach notes.

For its size, the wine is remarkably restrained, combining slightly resinous cherry fruit with hints of cinnamon, clove and mint. The finish is supple, suggesting early drinkability. Enjoy now–2017.\n87333\tAustralia\tFinisterre\t91\t30\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRobert Oatley 2014 Finisterre Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tRobert Oatley\tGT_90_Points\tThis is plump, custardy, leesy wine, with ample texture to support the flavors of toasted marshmallow, melon and citrus.

Clean and dry in the mouth, mineral and chalk are at the fore, with lime pith, soy and grass underneath. Finishes medium-long, with more of the same.\n14714\tAustralia\tThe Y Series\t89\t13\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2015 The Y Series Riesling (Barossa)\tRiesling\tYalumba\tLT_90_Points\tIt's nice to see high-quality dry Riesling at such a reasonable price. This does show some riper, peachier aromas and flavors than truly classic Eden Valley Riesling, but it remains true to the regional style, just more approachable.

On the palate, it delivers an intriguing blend of vanilla and berries, marked by more sauvage elements of peppercorn and grilled beef, all wrapped in a sturdy, well built package of ample weight, adequate acidity and dusty tannins. Drink now–2020.

Like the last days of summer, this wine smells of drying flowers still on their stalks. Tart cherries, dried leaves, and medicinal herbs come through on the palate, which finishes smokey, like the dying embers of the last barbecue of the season.\n41772\tAustralia\tChurch Block\t91\t20\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWirra Wirra 2013 Church Block Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot-Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Merlot-Shiraz\tWirra Wirra\tGT_90_Points\tAt 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a firm, cassis-scented wine, but one that includes hints of ripeness and generous fruit.

The 2009 features hints of mocha, vanilla and red plum on the nose, accented by a pinch of peppery cinnamon. In the mouth, it's medium to full in body and richly textured without being over the top, then ends on a warming spice note. Drink now and over the next few years.\n39104\tAustralia\tWarboys Vineyard\t91\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAngove 2014 Warboys Vineyard Shiraz-Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz-Grenache\tAngove\tGT_90_Points\tRecently, Angove's various Warboys Vineyard bottlings have been consistently excellent; the 2014 blends 57% Shiraz and 43% Grenache to good effect. It's full bodied, creamy and supple, combining vanilla notes with hints of mint and an ample dose of cherry-berry fruit. Drink now through 2022.\n5156\tAustralia\tHickinbotham\t87\t45\tSouth Australia\tClarendon\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tClarendon Hills 2007 Hickinbotham Grenache (Clarendon)\tGrenache\tClarendon Hills\tLT_90_Points\tThe 2007 Hickinbotham features attractive scents of ground spices, leather and red cherries, but doesn't seem to have the richness and depth of CH's other Grenaches this year. Tart cherry-berry fruit fades into finely textured tannins on the finish. Drink now–2015.\n36673\tAustralia\tJester\t92\t22\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMitolo 2014 Jester Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tMitolo\tGT_90_Points\tThe finest Jester Cabernet I can remember, this full-bodied yet supple wine features aromas of cassis, cedar and vanilla in fine balance.

Drink now–2028.\n73016\tAustralia\tReserve\t90\t18\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCriterion 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCriterion\tGT_90_Points\tCriterion is a so-called global brand, offering Italian Pinot Grigio, Rioja and Chianti Classico among other benchmarks. This Coonawarra Cabernet is surprisingly good given that background. It offers cherry, cassis and tobacco notes, medium body and silky tannins. Drink it over the next 5–8 years.\n120538\tAustralia\tWhite Label\t91\t32\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWolf Blass 2010 White Label Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tWolf Blass\tGT_90_Points\tWhen a producer renowned for its red wines can turn out an elegant, understated white of this quality, you know Australian Chardonnay has firmly arrived. Subtle accents of toasted nuts frame citrusy fruit, and while the wine is full-bodied and round in the mouth, it remains focused and long and on the finish. If you're fortunate enough to get some of the 600 bottles imported, drink the wine over the next couple of years.\n70650\tAustralia\t\t86\t12\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMcWilliam's Hanwood Estate 2006 Riesling (South Eastern Australia)\tRiesling\tMcWilliam's Hanwood Estate\tLT_90_Points\tSeems slightly confected and perhaps a little off-dry, but it exhibits tasty cinnamon and baked-apple flavors and a dash of peppery spice on the finish. Drink now. Imported by McWilliam's Hanwood Estate.\n55229\tAustralia\tPillar Box White\t87\t12\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenry's Drive Vignerons 2007 Pillar Box White White (South Australia)\tWhite Blend\tHenry's Drive Vignerons\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine starts off a touch rubbery, so give it some air prior to serving if you can. The payoff is a pleasant mix of pear and citrus that's fairly broad on the palate yet balanced, and lengthy, too. This year's blend is 56% Chardonnay, 30% Sauvignon Blanc and 14% Verdelho.\n116886\tAustralia\tHanlin Hill\t91\t22\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPetaluma 2012 Hanlin Hill Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tPetaluma\tGT_90_Points\tThis is floral on the nose, offering up hints of talcum powder and restrained fruit. Yet the apple, cinnamon and lime flavors bust out on the palate before ending in a long, potent, citrusy finish. Drink now or hold up to 10 years.\n80896\tAustralia\tReserve\t86\t21\tNew South Wales\tOrange\t\t\t\tLogan Australia 1999 Reserve Chardonnay (Orange)\tChardonnay\tLogan Australia\tLT_90_Points\tFocused in the mouth with just a touch of creaminess, the Logan offers pear and nutmeg flavors, and a hint of green apple on the finish. It's not a mouthfilling, overly flashy wine, but this could be a good thing if you're pouring it with dinner. Try it with your first-course seafood dish.\n75528\tAustralia\tEntity\t93\t40\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJohn Duval Wines 2014 Entity Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tJohn Duval Wines\tGT_90_Points\tDark berry and plum fruit dominates, but hints of mint, vanilla and cedar add interest. Somewhere between silky and velvety, this full-bodied, richly textured Shiraz finishes long and appears to have the tannic structure to age well, though it's delicious now.\n50460\tAustralia\t\t87\t30\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAramis 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tAramis\tLT_90_Points\tPerhaps this wine just needs some additional cellaring, as the finish is long enough to suggest promise, but this particular bottle was in a cranky stage, showing lots of toasted oak and coffee-like aromas and tart acidity. The tannins seem ripe, so it's worth trying again in a year or two.\n83505\tAustralia\t\t86\t36\tWestern Australia\tPemberton\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSalitage 2005 Pinot Noir (Pemberton)\tPinot Noir\tSalitage\tLT_90_Points\tA pretty, relatively lightweight Pinot Noir, this offering from Western Australia starts off with hints of coffee and sour cherries, then develops more herbal notes and brown sugar with air. Flavors of cola, tart cherries and root vegetables finish a bit short.\n107999\tAustralia\tSavitar\t93\t75\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMitolo 2007 Savitar Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tMitolo\tGT_90_Points\tMitolo's top Shiraz offering from 2007 is its Savitar bottling, from McLaren Vale. This full-bodied, creamy, lush, expansive wine features aromas of toast and vanilla upfront, followed by mixed berries that seem to grow in intensity with every sip. Drink now-2020.\n67009\tAustralia\tSt. Henri\t93\t65\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenfolds 2007 St. Henri Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tPenfolds\tGT_90_Points\tThe 2007 St. Henri remains broodingly dark in both color and flavor profile. Blackberry and plum notes are accented by roasted meat, leather and mocha in this full-bodied, densely packed wine. The tannins are a bit chewy right now, but the finish is long and reveals promising glimmers of fruit that portend well for aging. Drink 2018–2025 and beyond.\n127596\tAustralia\tThe Olive Grove\t83\t15\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2001 The Olive Grove Chardonnay (McLaren Vale)\tChardonnay\tD'Arenberg\tLT_90_Points\tAromas are musky and nutty at the same time, but also mix in some grapefruit notes. It tastes largely neutral, except for a dollop of baking spices that turn aggressively peppery on the lean finish.\n8172\tAustralia\tA Thousand Words\t87\t18\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLambert 2014 A Thousand Words Chardonnay (Barossa Valley)\tChardonnay\tLambert\tLT_90_Points\tMedium to full in weight and opulent in texture, this is a buttery creamy wine that reflects its South Australian origin. Broad and rich, it's a throwback to a previous generation's style of Chardonnay.\n123090\tAustralia\tM\t92\t70\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKilikanoon 2006 M Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tKilikanoon\tGT_90_Points\tAged in 100% new French oak, this wine opens with scents of vanilla and pipe tobacco, but also shows a strong core of ripe raspberries. Mixed berries take over on the palate, softly framed by layers of mocha and vanilla. This full-bodied wine's tannins are creamy in texture, just turning ever so slightly dusty on the long finish. Drink now-2023.\n31363\tAustralia\tThe Howling Dog\t92\t42\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMassena 2006 The Howling Dog Petite Sirah (Barossa Valley)\tPetite Sirah\tMassena\tGT_90_Points\tAn inky wine, yet remarkably well balanced and supple, marrying a lush, creamy texture with masses of blueberries and hints of mint and licorice.

The latest NV release is toasty on the nose, then offers just faint hints of peach or berry flavors. It's lithe yet creamy on the palate, with a long finish.\n122430\tAustralia\tAnaperenna\t95\t80\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGlaetzer 2010 Anaperenna Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon\tGlaetzer\tGT_90_Points\tThese blends are traditional in Australia—they're just rarely this good. The 26% Cabernet gives great backbone and a sense of restraint to the wine, which might otherwise seem overdone or sloppy. Instead, there's a blend of blueberry and cassis fruit, Port-like spices and a long, dusty finish. Drink 2015–2025, possibly beyond.\n58025\tAustralia\t\t90\t22\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tShaw and Smith 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)\tSauvignon Blanc\tShaw and Smith\tGT_90_Points\tThis winery has made a nice Sauvignon Blanc as far back as I can remember. The 2016 is a linear, precise example, tightly focused and crisp on the finish. The ample pineapple and grapefruit aromas and flavors are zesty and refreshing.\n87414\tAustralia\tBrooks Road\t94\t75\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHickinbotham 2013 Brooks Road Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tHickinbotham\tGT_90_Points\tAs Australian vineyards go, this isn't that old, having been planted in 1971. Chocolate and vanilla shadings frame bowls of mixed berries in this full-bodied, powerful wine. It finishes long and intense, outlined by dusty tannins.\n110518\tAustralia\t\t90\t12\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tParinga 2015 Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tParinga\tGT_90_Points\tThis is the sort of stereotypical Aussie Shiraz the haters love to hate. It's full-bodied, warm and plush, oozing with blackberries and plums and loaded up with vanilla and mocha. Yet it's well done, inexpensive and just plain delicious. Drink now–2020.\n652\tAustralia\t\t92\t21\tWestern Australia\tGreat Southern\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPlantagenet 2014 Riesling (Great Southern)\tRiesling\tPlantagenet\tGT_90_Points\tBased on this example and a few other informal tastings, 2014 will be a top vintage for Rieslings from Western Australia. Aromas of lime sherbet and wet stone lead into a crisply focused palate loaded with citrusy tartness that lingers on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now with shellfish, and consider holding some for up to 10 years.\n44543\tAustralia\tSneaky\t90\t15\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKillibinbin 2013 Sneaky Shiraz (Langhorne Creek)\tShiraz\tKillibinbin\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a supple, creamy-textured Shiraz to enjoy through 2020. Red-fruit notes of strawberry and raspberry marry easily with dark hints of plum and mocha, then linger gently on the finish.\n104037\tAustralia\t\t92\t21\tWestern Australia\tGreat Southern\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPlantagenet 2014 Chardonnay (Great Southern)\tChardonnay\tPlantagenet\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a terrific Chardonnay at a great price, offering subtle notes of toasted grain upfront, followed by bright lemon-lime fruit and crisp acidity. It's medium-bodied, so it won't overpower whatever food you serve it with and the laser beam of citrusy acidity on the finish is wrapped in a gauzy sheath of pleasant nuttiness. Drink now–2020, possibly longer.\n107457\tAustralia\tThe Pennant Hand Selected Limited Release\t94\t50\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRobert Oatley 2011 The Pennant Hand Selected Limited Release Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tRobert Oatley\tGT_90_Points\tNearing maturity, this is a full-bodied, rich Chardonnay despite weighing in at only 12.5% abv. Scents of custard-meringue pie become more pungent and savory with air, adding hints of roasted mushrooms, smoke and maybe even some bacon fat. The flavors are savory yet the fruit remains, culminating in a long, ripe-citrus finish.\n72747\tAustralia\tHeytesbury\t94\t110\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tVasse Felix 2012 Heytesbury Red (Margaret River)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tVasse Felix\tGT_90_Points\tThis vintage, VF's flagship red is a blend of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Malbec and 7% Petit Verdot. Although it's full-bodied and lush, it's by no means the world's biggest or ripest Cabernet blend. Instead, it's impeccably balanced and gentle, serving up cassis, vanilla and a touch of baking spices in generous swirls that reach a crescendo on the long finish. Drink now–2030.\n28573\tAustralia\tAstralis\t95\t350\tSouth Australia\tClarendon\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tClarendon Hills 2005 Astralis Syrah (Clarendon)\tSyrah\tClarendon Hills\tGT_90_Points\tAstralis has become one of Australia's top collectibles, and Roman Bratasiuk's 2005 version is once again top-shelf stuff. It's full-bodied and rich without being over the top, balancing dark-chocolate-covered blackberries and blueberries with more complex savory notes (spice, grilled meat). While it's a big, hulking wine at first, the finish shows great elegance and finesse, ending with silky tannins. Best from 2014. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited.\n83808\tAustralia\tAestatis\t93\t49\tSouth Australia\tSouthern Fleurieu\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSalomon Estate 2009 Aestatis G-S-M (Southern Fleurieu)\tG-S-M\tSalomon Estate\tGT_90_Points\tAustrian Bert Salomon has turned out a wonderful Grenache-based blend.

It's buttery and full, yet possesses a stony mineral quality that gives it balance. Initial peppery-spicy notes on the finish smooth out the longer it sits in the glass.

Instead, it delivers rich and mellow flavors of black cherry, tinged with licorice, earth and moss. Drink it over the next several years.\n128742\tAustralia\tLunatiq\t90\t47\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\t\t\tTyrrell's 2013 Lunatiq Shiraz (Heathcote)\tShiraz\tTyrrell's\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a powerful Shiraz, with heady notes of sweet spice, Dr. Pepper and chocolate on the nose. Ripe dark berries, violet and stoney notes are plentiful on the palate, supported by fine, integrated tannins.

A solid effort.\n73233\tAustralia\t\t92\t50\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDexter 2012 Pinot Noir (Mornington Peninsula)\tPinot Noir\tDexter\tGT_90_Points\tOwner-winemaker Tod Dexter and his wife Debbie planted their first vines in 1987, making them reasonably mature for the region. The result is a medium-bodied restrained yet silky and seductive Pinot Noir. Black cherry, cola, cedar and spice elements combine easily on the nose and palate, then linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now–2020.\n20044\tAustralia\tBreechens\t91\t18\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMaverick 2014 Breechens Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tMaverick\tGT_90_Points\tIt's hard to believe such a wine can come from the Barossa, a region known for size and richness. But this is part of a new wave of Aussie Shiraz—medium in body and silky in style, with moderate alcohol levels. Healthy doses of oak impart notes of hickory smoke, cedar and vanilla to the plum fruit.

It's soft and mouthfilling—an easy-drinking Cab to consume on the young side.\n1723\tAustralia\tNine Gums Vineyard\t85\t30\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBrick Road 2005 Nine Gums Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tBrick Road\tLT_90_Points\tTart blackberry and vanilla flavors mark this bold Shiraz that shows its 14.5% alcohol. There's a rubbery note on the nose that's a bit distracting but should be taken care of by a quick decanting, while black olive and coffee notes emerge on the slightly warm finish.\n60416\tAustralia\tBarking Mad\t88\t17\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tReilly's 2006 Barking Mad Shiraz (Clare Valley)\tShiraz\tReilly's\tLT_90_Points\tFull-bodied and embued with tannins supple to the point of creaminess, this dark-fruited Shiraz offers flavors of leather, cola, espresso and bits of black olive and tar.

Hints of vanilla and graham crackers accent mixed berry fruit, while the finish is long and mouthwatering. There's ample concentration, yet the wine never seems heavy. Drinkable now, but why rush things? Drink 2020–2030.\n78421\tAustralia\tRSW\t90\t60\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWirra Wirra 2005 RSW Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tWirra Wirra\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a full-throttle, rich and moderately dense Shiraz with bold aromas of raspberry and plum. Chocolate notes develop on the palate, adding more complexity. Velvety on the finish, where there's also a touch of alcoholic warmth. Imported by International Vines, Inc.\n86096\tAustralia\tFingers Crossed Red\t89\t10\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMarlargo 2006 Fingers Crossed Red Red (South Australia)\tRed Blend\tMarlargo\tLT_90_Points\tThis unlikely blend of 87% Shiraz and 13% Petit Verdot hits the right notes for a bargain sipper, boasting plenty of weight and an interesting juxtaposition of raspberry fruit with dark chocolate. Earthy notes provide depth, and the finish is surprisingly silky for a wine in this price range. Drink now.\n85059\tAustralia\tEmily's Paddock Shiraz-Cabernet Franc\t89\t125\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJasper Hill 2007 Emily's Paddock Shiraz-Cabernet Franc Red (Heathcote)\tRed Blend\tJasper Hill\tLT_90_Points\tIn 5–10 years, this rating may look conservative, but right now, this wine's tannins are just too rustic and tough to be certain of its future evolution. It's a massive wine overall, with brambly, briary fruit, tinged with clove, cedar and chocolate, and those drying, astringent tannins on the finish.\n49800\tAustralia\t\t91\t\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBalnaves of Coonawarra 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tBalnaves of Coonawarra\tGT_90_Points\tThis isn't Coonawarra's most elegant wine, but it certainly doesn't lack for character or concentration. Menthol, vanilla, cedar and cassis deliver plenty of flavor in this chunky, full-bodied Cabernet. Charred, mocha-like notes emerge on the long, intense finish. Drink now–2025.\n61909\tAustralia\tThe Long Paddock\t86\t10\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\t\t\tRedbank 2008 The Long Paddock Pinot Grigio (Victoria)\tPinot Grigio\tRedbank\tLT_90_Points\tHere's an Italian-styled Pinot Grigio, with a gently nutty nose and earthy low notes. It's faintly oily in the mouth but finishes crisp and light, with a pretty lemon zest accent. Drink up.\n24496\tAustralia\tSV\t90\t28\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLoom 2013 SV Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills)\tPinot Noir\tLoom\tGT_90_Points\tIt's refreshing to see another importer take a chance on Pinot Noir from the Adelaide Hills, a region that can reliably ripen the variety at reasonable crop loads. This is a rounder, more supple style of Pinot than most from Australia, with cola, spice and cherry notes reminiscent of Dr. Pepper, or of some Pinots from California's Russian River Valley. Drink now–2020.\n7828\tAustralia\t\t87\t39\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tStefano Lubiana 1999 Pinot Noir (Tasmania)\tPinot Noir\tStefano Lubiana\tLT_90_Points\tSmells like Pinot, combining leather, smoke and tart cherry aromas. In the mouth, this light-to-medium-weight wine doesn't show a lot of fruity flavors, but rather leather, dried spices and dusty notes. Juicy cherries gradually emerge on the finish.\n107532\tAustralia\tEmily May Pinot Noir\t86\t25\tSouth Australia\t\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKoonara 2016 Emily May Pinot Noir Rosé\tRosé\tKoonara\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine combines notes of melon and candied apple with hints of pepper and ginger. Despite its modest alcohol level, it seems weighty, and even a bit sweet, then finishes on a mouthwatering, spicy note.\n62619\tAustralia\t\t88\t35\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYeringberg 2013 Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)\tChardonnay\tYeringberg\tLT_90_Points\tMade in a lighter, more delicate style than many of its brethren, this is nevertheless fresh and flavorful. Pear, melon and white peach notes are framed by hints of toasted brioche, which takes on a slightly mocha-like character on the finish.\n77718\tAustralia\t\t83\t5\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBanrock Station 2006 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)\tChardonnay\tBanrock Station\tLT_90_Points\tPossibly a little sweet, this is a soft, easygoing Chardonnay marked by clean, modest pear and melon flavors.\n129414\tAustralia\tMort's Block\t89\t20\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\t\t\tKilikanoon 2016 Mort's Block Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tKilikanoon\tLT_90_Points\tA bit more austere than some of Kilikanoon's other cuveés, Mort's Block is in it for the long haul. Still a baby, it currently shows lemon-lime characters, with kerosene and Barbie doll plastic. The palate is linear and supercitrusy. Drink 2018–2025.\n111405\tAustralia\tRedstone\t85\t20\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\t\t\tCoriole 2005 Redstone Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tCoriole\tLT_90_Points\tAn entry-level label for Coriole, the 2005 Redstone Shiraz features slightly earthy aromas combined with scents of dusty wood and modest blackberries. The tannins are a bit gripping on the finish; this wine might benefit from a year or two of bottle age.\n86886\tAustralia\t\t87\t10\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHope Estate 2000 Chardonnay (Hunter Valley)\tChardonnay\tHope Estate\tLT_90_Points\tStarts off with understated aromas of buttered whole-grain toast, pineapple and tropical that gradually build in intensity, finishing with a blast of toasty American oak, vanilla and spice. It's slightly unpolished, but flavorful and full of character.\n105041\tAustralia\tPrickly\t87\t11\tVictoria\tAlpine Valleys\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFrisk 2015 Prickly Riesling (Alpine Valleys)\tRiesling\tFrisk\tLT_90_Points\tPrickly refers to the wine's texture, which is definitely lightly frizzante (spritzy). That helps boost the wine's aromas, making it perfumed and floral, even Muscat-like. It's light in body and slightly off dry, with notes of apricot, apple blossom and gingery spice. Drink now.\n2965\tAustralia\t\t85\t16\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRed Mud 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tRed Mud\tLT_90_Points\tShows some slightly green tomato-leaf and bell-pepper notes as well as hints of leather and hung game, but despite all that, there's also ripe cassis and chocolate flavors and a supple mouthfeel.

A well-priced Cabernet for near-term consumption or restaurant wine lists.\n86348\tAustralia\tIndividual Vineyard Selection Dry\t89\t17\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPewsey Vale 2014 Individual Vineyard Selection Dry Riesling (Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tPewsey Vale\tLT_90_Points\tFor such a young wine, this seems surprisingly developed—or maybe it's just riper than usual. It may lack in bracing lemon-lime department, but hints of apple blossoms and tropical fruit turn spicy and a bit apricot-like on the long finish.\n46459\tAustralia\tThe Chook\t89\t19\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWoop Woop 2009 The Chook Shiraz-Viognier (South Australia)\tShiraz-Viognier\tWoop Woop\tLT_90_Points\tA charmingly complex medium-weight red, with raspberry fruit, peppery spice and dark chocolate notes all coated in a soft, fine dusting of tannins.

Instead, it's grippy and tough, with a veneer of dry, woody tannins over flavors of vanilla, cedar and cinnamon.\n3135\tAustralia\t\t89\t17\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWildberry Estate 2005 Shiraz (Margaret River)\tShiraz\tWildberry Estate\tLT_90_Points\tFull-bodied and firm, this dark-fruited Shiraz an be consumed now with rare beef or lamb, or cellared 2–3 years.

On the full-bodied palate, a crunchy mix of red and black fruit comes to the fore, but deep, savory notes of espresso and black olive emerge on the finish.\n118809\tAustralia\tLangi\t89\t60\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMount Langi Ghiran 2004 Langi Shiraz (Victoria)\tShiraz\tMount Langi Ghiran\tLT_90_Points\tThis winery always seem to offer a more European style of Shiraz, combining slightly earthy, dusty notes with savory hints of spiced meat and fresh dark-berried fruit. The 2004 shows a fair amount of complexity allied to firm tannins and crisp acids, and will probably require another 4–5 years to show its best.\n15982\tAustralia\t\t86\t8\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\t\t\tBanrock Station 2015 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)\tShiraz\tBanrock Station\tLT_90_Points\tRipe black cherry and a lick of herbs are wrapped up in a solid structure of balanced acidity and tannins, with a slightly savory finish. The oak is prominent, as is the ripe fruit, but for the price, this is the kind of bargain Shiraz Australia once built its Stateside reputation on.\n89680\tAustralia\tThe Little Villager\t84\t18\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tStable Hill 2013 The Little Villager Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills)\tPinot Noir\tStable Hill\tLT_90_Points\tCranberries and pie cherries give a crisp, almost citrusy, edge to this wine. The tannins are silky and there's some appealing clove-like spice as well, but the acids are elevated, making the wine come across as tart and ungenerous.\n73036\tAustralia\tTwo Passions\t90\t20\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWildberry Estate 2013 Two Passions Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tWildberry Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThis restrained, medium-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon is a solid value. On the nose, cedar, vanilla and cassis elements blend together easily, while brown sugar and vanilla flavors are supported by just enough cassis and black cherry fruit. Drink now–2028.\n16644\tAustralia\tRobinson Vineyard\t93\t55\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMoorooduc 2012 Robinson Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mornington Peninsula)\tPinot Noir\tMoorooduc\tGT_90_Points\tWorth the effort to find, this wine shows terrific balance in every respect. Subtle oak and spice frame ripe cherry fruit on the nose. Refreshing herb and spice elements add zest to cherry and cola flavors on the palate, where the wine is fleshy without being at all heavy. The ripe tannins on the finish are supple enough to make this approachable now, but it should also evolve gracefully for at least five-to-eight years.\n92366\tAustralia\tTwo Left Feet\t84\t28\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMollydooker 2015 Two Left Feet Red (South Australia)\tRed Blend\tMollydooker\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine's alcohol is apparent from the start, as is a huge oak component and jammy, confected fruit. It's cedary, minty and grapy, with a warm, woody finish.\n101419\tAustralia\tRegional Series\t87\t22\tWestern Australia\tMount Barker\t\t\t\tCapel Vale 2005 Regional Series Shiraz (Mount Barker)\tShiraz\tCapel Vale\tLT_90_Points\tMixed berry, cola and cedar notes dominate the nose, while the palate is packed with cherry cola and leather flavors. The dense texture could use some time to open up, and that suggestion of ageability is reinforced by the finish's dry, dusty tannins. Drink 2010–15. Imported by Tom Eddy Wines.\n77037\tAustralia\tRunRig\t96\t225\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2007 RunRig Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz-Viognier\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tWinemaker Dave Powell is no longer with Torbreck, but the 2007 RunRig is one of his finest efforts. The complexity is almost overwhelming, as the aromas range from peppery spice and roasted meat to blueberry and tappanade. It's mouth filling and expansive, yet retains fine acids and just the right amount of slightly dusty tannins on the long finish. Approachable now, but capable of lasting at least though 2020.\n86945\tAustralia\tThe High Trellis\t90\t19\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2006 The High Trellis Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tFeaturing tobacco, cassis and lesser quantities of mint and cocoa, d'Arenberg's The High Trellis Cabernet is a full-bodied wine that offers plenty of flavor interest and depth at a reasonable price. It does show some slightly chewy, dusty tannins on the finish, but the fruit ultimately wins through, suggesting it will be at its best from 2010–2020.\n39961\tAustralia\tGrange\t96\t185\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tPenfolds 1996 Grange Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tPenfolds\tGT_90_Points\tAs unevolved as they are, the dense and multilayered aromas and flavors are truly impressive here. Black currant, herb, tea, oak, vanilla, maple, anise, blueberries and more--it could be an excercise in overkill, if all the parts weren't in such fine harmony. Really big, but with excellent balance, this reveals much less now than the RWT. It is everything a flagship wine in its infancy should be--immaculate component parts, superbly full on the palate, possessed of great length and incredible potential. An absolute keeper to visit in 7, 15 or 25 years. To be released 5/01.\n66656\tAustralia\tDB Family Selection Sparkling Brut\t88\t12\tNew South Wales\tRiverina\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDe Bortoli NV DB Family Selection Sparkling Brut Sparkling (Riverina)\tSparkling Blend\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tThis is straightforward, well-made tank-fermented fizz at a bargain price.

Apple flavors provide roundness, while the wine finishes citrusy and fresh without being sharp.\n119029\tAustralia\tAlexanders Vineyard\t88\t15\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFranklin Tate 2013 Alexanders Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tFranklin Tate\tLT_90_Points\tThis plush, full-bodied Cabernet comes across as slightly Shiraz-like, but still represents good value for $15. Smoky, toasty notes of charred oak frame black olive and cola notes, while some red fruit does peek through from time to time. Drink this ready-to-drink Cabernet through 2020.\n92017\tAustralia\t\t85\t20\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHill of Content 2005 Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills)\tPinot Noir\tHill of Content\tLT_90_Points\tDespite a slightly bitter edge to its raspberry and charred-oak flavors, this medium-bodied Pinot Noir delivers plenty of pleasure.

Palate also offers some yellow fruit and an a fresh herbal streak (or maybe it's pine needles?). The same herbal note shows again on the finish.\n94840\tAustralia\t\t89\t23\tWestern Australia\tFrankland River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAlkoomi 2004 Shiraz-Viognier (Frankland River)\tShiraz-Viognier\tAlkoomi\tLT_90_Points\tAlkoomi's Shiraz-Viognier features mildly herbal, peppery qualities to go with fresh, red-berried fruit and a touch of coffee.

It's dry in the mouth, with lime skin and a bold rocky-slatey sort of minerality. Has a slight spritz in the mouth, with star fruit on the finish and melon notes on the nose.\n96540\tAustralia\tStone Cutting No Oak\t87\t20\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPauletts 2009 Stone Cutting No Oak Chardonnay (Clare Valley)\tChardonnay\tPauletts\tLT_90_Points\tA lean, crisp style of Chardonnay, with citrusy flavors and a touch of honeyed development.

Fig, melon and citrus aromas and flavors hit the right buttons, then finish on a lingering note. Drink now.\n77425\tAustralia\t\t87\t25\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\t\t\tTamar Ridge 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Tasmania)\tSauvignon Blanc\tTamar Ridge\tLT_90_Points\tThe cool climate of Tasmania has lent this crisp white an edge of racy acidity that supports intense mineral, mango and cut grass notes. It turns somewhat softer on the finish but remains an impressive, well-balanced effort. Drink now.\n9808\tAustralia\t1919\t93\t100\tSouth Australia\tWrattonbully\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCasella 2007 1919 Shiraz (Wrattonbully)\tShiraz\tCasella\tGT_90_Points\tIt will be interesting to see if the release of this luxury-level Shiraz (the second vintage) has any impact on the perception of Casella's other brands: Yellow Tail and Peter Lehmann. Even at nine years of age, this is impressively dark and intense, with minty notes, cedar and vanilla and meaty, umami-like flavors that linger on the long, silky finish. Drink now.\n125642\tAustralia\tThe Stump Jump\t88\t11\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2007 The Stump Jump White (McLaren Vale)\tWhite Blend\tD'Arenberg\tLT_90_Points\tIt's almost two-thirds Riesling, which gives the wine its tight focus and strong mineral and citrus overtones, but there's also Sauvignon Blanc, Marsanne, Viognier and Chardonnay in the mix, giving it layers of fruity complexity. Awfully good for the price.\n34502\tAustralia\tThe Relic\t98\t135\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tStandish 2006 The Relic Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tStandish\tGT_90_Points\tThis prodigious wine showcases Barossa's ability to deliver big, mouthfilling flavors without any suggestion of heat or heaviness. Scents of stone fruit, pepper and red currants mark the nose, while the flavors take on a darker cast, heading toward black cherries and black olives. The tannins are supremely silky, but this graceful, feminine beauty should drink well through at least 2020.\n7072\tAustralia\tAre You Game?\t84\t17\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFowles Wine 2012 Are You Game? Pinot Noir (Victoria)\tPinot Noir\tFowles Wine\tLT_90_Points\tThere's 10% Zinfandel blended into this wine, but looking at my notes, I never would've thought so. The pale color is all Pinot Noir, as are the aromas of earth and tomato (the vanilla comes from the French oak barrels). It's light and crisp, with a tart finish.\n82089\tAustralia\t\t86\t9\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSt. Kilda 2014 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)\tChardonnay\tSt. Kilda\tLT_90_Points\tThis is the sort of Chardonnay that first put Australia on the radar of many American wine drinkers. It fits the “cheap and cheerful” description to a tee, offering hints of toast, medium body and clean, refreshing fruit flavors of pear, melon and pineapple.

Smoky cedar and mocha notes complement plums and blackberries, turning velvety on the finish.

The wine is medium bodied and not very tannic, making it easy to sip repeatedly. Drink it over the next 8–10 years.\n23150\tAustralia\tPlexus Shiraz-Grenache-Mourvèdre\t90\t40\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJohn Duval Wines 2012 Plexus Shiraz-Grenache-Mourvèdre G-S-M (Barossa Valley)\tG-S-M\tJohn Duval Wines\tGT_90_Points\tLike all the Duval wines, this is amply structured.

Briery, herbal shadings frame blackberry fruit, while the finish features a mouthwatering combination of mocha, dark fruit and lingering tannins. Drink this medium-bodied Cabernet now through 2025.\n58218\tAustralia\t\t90\t15\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChateau Reynella 2005 Chardonnay (McLaren Vale)\tChardonnay\tChateau Reynella\tGT_90_Points\tUnusually complex for a wine in this price range, marrying grilled peaches with hints of toasted hazelnut and bacon fat, and wrapped in a layer of cedary, vanilla-scented oak. Medium-bodied, with a long, subtly oaky finish.\n76216\tAustralia\t\t94\t60\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTolpuddle 2014 Chardonnay (Tasmania)\tChardonnay\tTolpuddle\tGT_90_Points\tThe Pinot Noir is no slouch either, but Tolpuddle's 2014 Chardonnay is super. Faint hints of crème brûlée mark the nose, then ease into lime, pineapple and white peach notes on the palate. It's only medium in weight, but with a silky feel and a long mouthwatering finish. Drink now through 2022.\n13551\tAustralia\t\t85\t14\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\t\t\tElement 2001 Chardonnay (Western Australia)\tChardonnay\tElement\tLT_90_Points\tSmells sweet and soft, with vanilla, peach and caramel aromas.

This wine is full bodied and ripe on the palate, with a soft finish.\n36422\tAustralia\tBoarding Pass\t87\t20\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tR Wines 2007 Boarding Pass Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tR Wines\tLT_90_Points\tA bit spicier than the other R Wines Shirazes, the 2007 Boarding Pass features mainly McLaren Vale fruit, offering blackberry tinged with coffee and peppery spice.

It's full in the mouth, with a creamy texture that turns chewier on the finish—perfect alongside rare beef or lamb. Drink now-2018.\n3099\tAustralia\tBin 128\t88\t26\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenfolds 2007 Bin 128 Shiraz (Coonawarra)\tShiraz\tPenfolds\tLT_90_Points\tFrom a cooler region than its Bin 28 stablemate, Penfolds' 2007 Bin 128 is a medium-bodied Shiraz that features touches of peppery spice, raspberry-cherry fruit and a darker edge of chocolate and coffee. The tannins are supple without being soft, giving this a drinking window that should extend through 2017 or so.\n111210\tAustralia\tApplejack Vineyard\t88\t42\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGiant Steps 2011 Applejack Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)\tPinot Noir\tGiant Steps\tLT_90_Points\tThis crisp, delicate Pinot Noir should be consumed over the next few years for its elegant cherry and rose petal notes and silky tannins. Hints of scorched earth and dry leaves add extra interest to the reasonably complex bouquet.\n3594\tAustralia\tEmeri Moscato\t86\t13\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDe Bortoli NV Emeri Moscato Sparkling (South Eastern Australia)\tSparkling Blend\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tPale straw with a touch of green to its hue, this is a soft, easygoing Moscato redolent of oranges and pineapples.

It's plump and medium-bodied, with a clean, refreshing finish. What it isn't is particularly complex, but it will still go well with any number of seafood or chicken dishes this summer.\n54842\tAustralia\tDestinations\t85\t15\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLong Flat 2006 Destinations Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)\tPinot Noir\tLong Flat\tLT_90_Points\tIf you're looking for a clean, well made Pinot Noir at an affordable price, you could do a lot worse.

Superripe aromas of blackberries and licorice mark the nose, while the palate features similar flavors, supple tanins and a creamy-textured finish. Good to go now, with enough concentration to hold until 2015.\n106336\tAustralia\t\t91\t\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWarramate 2012 Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)\tPinot Noir\tWarramate\tGT_90_Points\tOne of Yarra's first wave of modern-day wineries, Warramate was founded in 1970, which means this comes from Pinot Noir vines that can legitimately be called old. The style is resolutely traditional, with crisp acids and a wiry backbone the standout features. Cedary oak further frames tart cherry fruit, which finishes long and crisp. Drink from 2018 through until 2025.\n96027\tAustralia\t\t88\t17\tWestern Australia\tFrankland River\t\t\t\tAlkoomi 2002 Riesling (Frankland River)\tRiesling\tAlkoomi\tLT_90_Points\tThough it is in the unscrewcapped minority, this is a well-built Riesling, and one that somehow seems engineered to please a wide-reaching audience. It offers white peach and other subtle fruit flavors dusted with sweet talc, make no mistake—its dry, minerally mouthfeel is the key player here. Has a little spritz in the mouth, with white pepper and a burst of peach fruit on the back end.\n13660\tAustralia\tMuscadelle\t86\t15\tVictoria\tRutherglen\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Muscadelle Tokay (Rutherglen)\tTokay\tChambers Rosewood Vineyards\tLT_90_Points\tMade mistelle fashion, with fortification taking place prior to fermentation to help preserve the variety's citrus and tea-leaf aromas and flavors. Honeyed orange and lemon flavors take on a leafy edge, showing a hint of bitterness on the finish.\n93911\tAustralia\tEmeri Sparkling\t85\t13\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\t\t\tDe Bortoli NV Emeri Sparkling Sauvignon Blanc (South Eastern Australia)\tSauvignon Blanc\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose is cagey, with yeast tones hiding behind apple and melon fruit. Some nice minerality emerges in the mouth, along with a ripe green pea tone that slides into fresh apple on the medium finish. The mousse could hang around a bit longer, but the irresistible fruit here means that it probably won't be in your glass long enough to matter. Drink now, with hors d'oeuvres.\n81837\tAustralia\tThe Y Series\t89\t12\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2014 The Y Series Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tYalumba\tLT_90_Points\tYalumba seems to trying more than most producers to rein in high alcohol levels, and the 2014 Y Series Shiraz is a very good effort. There's enough weight to give it substance without seeming overly heavy. Dark chocolate notes frame raspberry and plum fruit, then finish slightly dusty. Drink now–2023.\n12417\tAustralia\t\t88\t18\tSouth Australia\tLimestone Coast\t\t\t\tStonehaven 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Limestone Coast)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tStonehaven\tLT_90_Points\tDense, with plum-prune, coffee and chocolate aromas, this wine offers very ripe dark-fruit flavors accented by tobacco and cedar shadings. The mouthfeel is big, but very easy, even soft; with a little more spine-acidity and tannins-this wine could merit a higher score. Still, it's a very pleasing and promising first offering.\n124482\tAustralia\tSamuel's Garden Selection\t90\t19\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2014 Samuel's Garden Selection Roussanne (Eden Valley)\tRoussanne\tYalumba\tGT_90_Points\tFor Roussanne, this is surprisingly neutral on the nose. It's marginally more expressive on the palate, where it offers hints of paraffin and toasted marshmallow. Still, it's plump and mouthfilling, with an attractive hint of ginger on the long finish.\n126310\tAustralia\t\t92\t24\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSilkman 2015 Semillon (Hunter Valley)\tSémillon\tSilkman\tGT_90_Points\tScents of wet stone, paraffin and citrus ease into flavors of lemon, melon and tea on the palate. This is light in body and silky in feel, with a long, harmonious finish. Drink it now or age it up to 10 years, maybe even longer.\n101346\tAustralia\tEmeri Sparkling\t87\t13\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDe Bortoli NV Emeri Sparkling Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)\tShiraz\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tA more somber garnet color than some other sparkling Shirazes, with seemingly lower pressure and a more vinous character. Vanilla, leather and cherry notes finish close to dry. A very good, inexpensive introduction to the genre.\n117533\tAustralia\tThe Lodge Hill Dry\t90\t18\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJim Barry 2011 The Lodge Hill Dry Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tJim Barry\tGT_90_Points\tWet stone and lemon-lime. If those sound good to you, this ageworthy Riesling is a fit for you. It's medium in body yet very crisp and linear in structure, with a hint of citrus pith on the finish. Drink 2015–2020.\n67896\tAustralia\tLongford\t88\t36\tVictoria\tGippsland\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJinks Creek 2004 Longford Shiraz (Gippsland)\tShiraz\tJinks Creek\tLT_90_Points\tAn intriguingly savory Shiraz, laden with meaty, leathery aromas and flavors of pepper-cured meat and coffee. It's full-bodied and creamy in texture, with a lushness that persists through the finish. Drink now.\n27130\tAustralia\tBicheno Single Site\t87\t65\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDalrymple 2012 Bicheno Single Site Pinot Noir (Tasmania)\tPinot Noir\tDalrymple\tLT_90_Points\tPie cherry and rhubarb notes make a bright impression on the nose, followed by tart flavors bundled in a mocha-tinged wrapper. The texture is almost syrupy on the midpalate, but turns dry and dusty on the finish. This is a bit disjointed at this stage, so perhaps it will improve with cellaring. Try after 2018.\n35341\tAustralia\tIndividual Selection\t93\t50\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJohn's Blend 2003 Individual Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Langhorne Creek)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tJohn's Blend\tGT_90_Points\tFrom veteran winemaker John Glaetzer, this Cabernet from Langhorne Creek is something of a throwback, spending some 28 months in American oak hogsheads. Yet there's clearly enough cherry and cassis fruit to support all of the vanilla and toasted coconut, and the wine finishes long and balanced. Drink 2010–2020.\n90531\tAustralia\tJulius\t92\t43\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenschke 2015 Julius Riesling (Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tHenschke\tGT_90_Points\tClassic Eden Valley aromas of lemon-lime sherbet and wet stone mark the nose of this medium-bodied wine. That wet stone note carries through on the palate to yield a slightly chalky or crushed-stone texture, while the citrus fruits race through the long finish. Drink 2020–2030.\n24574\tAustralia\tThe Merle\t91\t40\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPikes 2014 The Merle Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tPikes\tGT_90_Points\tPike's top Riesling features aromas of crushed stone and damp moss, while the flavors bring to mind tangy limes and underripe nectarines. It's actually a bit rounder in feel than expected, then gains focus on the long finish.\n45282\tAustralia\tReserve\t92\t50\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenley Estate 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tPenley Estate\tGT_90_Points\tPenley's Reserve Cabernet sees 100% new French oak, but handles it well, blending coffee and brown sugar elements with fruitier notes of plum and a hint of mint. It's full-bodied and lushly textured, with smoky, cedary oak wrapped around a core of dark fruit. Drink now–2016.\n58205\tAustralia\tCellar No. One Reserve\t91\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChateau Reynella 2004 Cellar No. One Reserve Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tChateau Reynella\tGT_90_Points\tLoaded with smoke, hickory and vanilla, this definitely shows plenty of oak, but there's also plenty of fruit to balance the ledger. Cola and blackberry flavors pick up a slightly tart edge on the long, finely textured finish.\n20912\tAustralia\tMemsie Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec\t87\t14\tVictoria\tBendigo\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWater Wheel 2006 Memsie Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec Red (Bendigo)\tRed Blend\tWater Wheel\tLT_90_Points\tMainly Shiraz (87%), this is a meaty, savory and plummy red at a reasonable price. Hints of vanilla and cola impart additional complexity, while the mouthfeel is creamy, cushioned by ripe tannins. It drops off just a little on the finish, but it's still a very good drop for near-term consumption.\n81043\tAustralia\t1850 Old Vine\t89\t80\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCirillo 2005 1850 Old Vine Grenache (Barossa Valley)\tGrenache\tCirillo\tLT_90_Points\tAs might be expected, this has some familial similarities with the 2004 version (also reviewed this issue). It's full-bodied and dark-fruited, but the acids are brighter and the mouthfeel less luxurious, ending on a crisp note. Give it another year or two in the bottle to see if it develops more lushness.\n15821\tAustralia\tDB Family Selection Sparkling Brut\t85\t10\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDe Bortoli NV DB Family Selection Sparkling Brut Sparkling (South Eastern Australia)\tSparkling Blend\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tComes across as being on the sweet side of the brut spectrum, but it's still a solid value, offering bold pineapple flavors and just a hint of toast on the finish.\n46923\tAustralia\tThe Y Series\t89\t13\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2015 The Y Series Viognier (South Australia)\tViognier\tYalumba\tLT_90_Points\tA terrific value, this offers a surprising amount of varietal character for the price.

Drink now.\n1897\tAustralia\t\t89\t12\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRazor's Edge 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tRazor's Edge\tLT_90_Points\tA very good effort, this may be among the last great values to emerge from Australia, as smaller crops and changing currencies will undoubtedly take their toll. It's remarkable that McLaren Vale fruit can go into a $12 bottle. Black cherry fruit is presented on a medium-bodied, softly tannic frame, embellished by hints of cola and eucalyptus. Finishes soft, with a fine texture of charcoal dust and lingering cassis flavors.\n117992\tAustralia\tT Series Chardonnay-Pinot Noir-Pinot Meunier\t89\t13\tAustralia Other\tAustralia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTaltarni NV T Series Chardonnay-Pinot Noir-Pinot Meunier Sparkling (Australia)\tSparkling Blend\tTaltarni\tLT_90_Points\tA terrific value in sparkling wine, this slightly copper-tinged bubbly features classy aromas of dried thyme, citrus and apple.

A great option for summer entertaining.\n2642\tAustralia\tReserve\t89\t13\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJacob's Creek 2009 Reserve Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tJacob's Creek\tLT_90_Points\tEach Jacob's Creek Reserve wine is now sourced from a specific region, and this Chardonnay shows solid improvement as a result.

It's more like a light red than a true rosé, showing considerable weight and body, then finishes dry, with a hint of minerality.\n83970\tAustralia\tHeytesbury\t87\t30\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tVasse Felix 2000 Heytesbury Chardonnay (Western Australia)\tChardonnay\tVasse Felix\tLT_90_Points\tThe aromas are so promising, redolent of toast and pears, butter and nectarines, that expectations are high. And make no mistake—this is very good wine. It's just that a slightly resinous veneer of spicy oak largely dominates the palate and finish.\n22688\tAustralia\tDB Family Selection\t87\t9\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDe Bortoli 2008 DB Family Selection Petite Sirah (South Eastern Australia)\tPetite Sirah\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tMade in a soft, user-friendly style, the 2008 DB Family Selection Petite Sirah offers up a flavorful mouthful of plum and baking spices. It's medium-bodied, with a silkiness to the structure that belies the grape variety, yet that same softness makes it immediately appealing.

It's surprisingly complex, adding just enough red berry fruit into the mix while staying on the savory, herbal side of the tracks. The tannins are supple, fading into an ashy touch on the finish. Drink now and over the next few years.\n69687\tAustralia\tAndreas Polish Hill River\t85\t26\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPauletts 2004 Andreas Polish Hill River Syrah (Clare Valley)\tSyrah\tPauletts\tLT_90_Points\tA tart, hard-edged rendition of Clare Valley Shiraz, from the cool subsection known as Polish Hill better known for its Rieslings.

The wine just seems too restrained for its own good.\n27683\tAustralia\t\t85\t\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tColdstream Hills 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Yarra Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tColdstream Hills\tLT_90_Points\tColdstream Hills is better known for its Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs than its Sauvignon Blanc, but this is a solid effort. It's medium in body, with simple grapefruit and pineapple flavors and a crisp, clean finish.\n112461\tAustralia\tThe Derelict Vineyard\t89\t29\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2007 The Derelict Vineyard Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tD'Arenberg\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose of this wine features some delicately lifted floral scents, but also darker notes of brandied cherries and asphalt. Give it some breathing time to let the tarry notes fade and allow the red cherry and cinnamon red-hot flavors to emerge. Finishes long, mouthwatering and just a touch warming. Drink now–2014.\n85050\tAustralia\t\t89\t30\tNew South Wales\tTumbarumba\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHungerford Hill 2009 Chardonnay (Tumbarumba)\tChardonnay\tHungerford Hill\tLT_90_Points\tTumbarumba is an up-and-coming cool-climate viticulture region, and this Chardonnay is a fine example of why the area is considered to have promise.

The flavors on the palate are simpler—mainly cherry and strawberry fruit—but there's still a delicacy and juiciness that make this easy to knock back.\n11874\tAustralia\tMade With Organic Grapes\t90\t18\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2015 Made With Organic Grapes Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tYalumba\tGT_90_Points\tYalumba has been pushing the organic envelope in recent years, and this Shiraz is a winner. It's full bodied and supple nearly to the point of creaminess, but delivers mixed berry, vanilla and baking-spice flavors, all with a certain amount of elegance.

A medium-bodied wine with a long, mouthwatering finish, it's a tasty near-term drinker but should develop well for up to 10 years.\n14680\tAustralia\tThe Ironstone Pressings Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvèdre\t92\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2008 The Ironstone Pressings Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvèdre Red (McLaren Vale)\tRhône-style Red Blend\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tThis Grenache-based blend derives considerable structure from its Shiraz (38%) and Mourvèdre (7%) components, giving it more firmness, length and ageability than might be expected. Dark chocolate and berry aromas and flavors pick up hints of dried tobacco and other herbs, ending on a crisp note. Give it two or three years, then drink it over the next 10–12.\n116903\tAustralia\tNetley Road Vineyard\t91\t35\tWestern Australia\tFrankland River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFrankland Estate 2012 Netley Road Vineyard Riesling (Frankland River)\tRiesling\tFrankland Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThe plumpest of Frankland Estate's three single-vineyard bottlings in 2012, Netley Road offers subdued lime and tobacco aromas, then flavors of tangerine and pineapple.

There are enough hints of bright, raspberry-tinged fruit to warrant optimism about its aging trajectory, but at the moment it is dark, heavy and slightly scorched. Try after 2017.\n24564\tAustralia\tGun Metal\t91\t19\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHewitson 2015 Gun Metal Riesling (Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tHewitson\tGT_90_Points\tThis light- to medium-weight wine is drinkable now—try it with Coffin Bay oysters if you can—but should also age well for up to 15 years.

It's still a full-bodied wine, filled with savory, earthy notes of black olive and espresso, but the finish stands apart for its length and suaveness. Drink now–2025.\n65874\tAustralia\t\t90\t25\tWestern Australia\tGreat Southern\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPlantagenet 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Great Southern)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tPlantagenet\tGT_90_Points\tThis herbaceous Cabernet shows off the strengths of Western Australia: refined tannins, complex flavors and elegance galore.

Cedar, mint and cassis notes are a bit Cabernet-like, but the structure is pure Shiraz, broader and suppler than Cabernet, with a rich texture and a long finish.

Floral notes and hints of ripe cherries mark the nose, while the flavors feature cherry and vanilla.

It's not particularly rich or concentrated, but it is something that's uncommon at this price: balanced. That makes it an attractive by-the-glass option or barbecue companion. —J.C.\n19536\tAustralia\tKillerman's Run\t90\t20\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKilikanoon 2014 Killerman's Run Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tKilikanoon\tGT_90_Points\tFor $20, you could do a lot worse than to sample this wine, which boasts plenty of varietal character and ample quality.

Yes, it fades quickly on the finish, but this a wine to quaff, not age. Drink now.\n39962\tAustralia\tRWT\t95\t70\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\t\t\tPenfolds 1998 RWT Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tPenfolds\tGT_90_Points\tSeamless luxury from stem to stern, this ‘baby Grange' is  impressive juice. Blackberry, menthol and smoke play unusually elegantly on the nose, the texture is velvet on the tongue with dark berry, coffee, licorice and muted black pepper flavors. The superb, very long finish combines all the elements with wonderful finesse and a rare grace. Not inexpensive, but fairly priced; you could pay twice as much for half the wine, almost any day in any fine wine store in the country. To be released 5/01.\n72419\tAustralia\t\t84\t8\tAustralia Other\tAustralia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYellow Tail 2010 Malbec (Australia)\tMalbec\tYellow Tail\tLT_90_Points\tPossibly understating it, this Australian Malbec is boldly colored, with intensely fresh and grapy aromas and robust blueberry flavors. It's a bit simple and possibly a little on the sweet side, but fills the mouth with plenty of flavor.\n72061\tAustralia\t\t87\t21\tWestern Australia\tGreat Southern\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPlantagenet 2013 Riesling (Great Southern)\tRiesling\tPlantagenet\tLT_90_Points\tThe aromas and flavors of crushed stone, lime sherbet and green apple are spot on, but this crisp, medium-bodied dry Riesling lacks just a bit of texture and length. Try it as a mouthwatering apéritif.\n32297\tAustralia\tOmrah\t88\t15\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPlantagenet 2004 Omrah Cabernet Sauvignon (Western Australia)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tPlantagenet\tLT_90_Points\tA good value, this starts off a little shaky thanks to some barnyard scents on the nose, then rights itself. Herbal-tobacco notes accent plum-prune flavors in this medium-bodied wine with a creamy-smooth texture. Soft and easygoing, it's ideal to drink now.\n7829\tAustralia\t\t87\t21\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKangarilla Road 2000 Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tKangarilla Road\tLT_90_Points\tThis full-bodied effort goes down surprisingly easy.

But on the palate, it displays a tight, rather lean framework; there's more citrus than stone fruit, finishing crisp rather than particularly rich or nuanced.\n64914\tAustralia\t\t88\t18\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSidewood 2013 Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tSidewood\tLT_90_Points\tAnother fine effort from Sidewood, a winery in the Adelaide Hills that is making some solid wines at realistic prices. Although this wine sees six months of French oak, the oak flavoring impact is minimal, and the wine shows ample fruit, ranging from pear and melon through peach and pineapple. It's a reasonably rich, fruity quaff for summertime drinking.\n13528\tAustralia\tLieu Dit Malakoff\t92\t30\tVictoria\tPyrenees\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDomaine Terlato & Chapoutier 2007 Lieu Dit Malakoff Shiraz (Pyrenees)\tShiraz\tDomaine Terlato & Chapoutier\tGT_90_Points\tThis partnership continues to turn out marvelously complex wines from inland Victoria. Savory, herbal and intriguing on the nose, with hints of raspberry, mushroom and smoked meat, this is a medium-bodied, supple wine. Dusty tannins impart a silky quality to the finish. Drink now–2018.\n11853\tAustralia\tAvalon Tree Single Site\t84\t16\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tZonte's Footstep 2008 Avalon Tree Single Site Cabernet Sauvignon (Langhorne Creek)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tZonte's Footstep\tLT_90_Points\tFeatures charred and herbal overtones, but otherwise pleasant cherry fruit and a weightiness borne of moderately high alcohol (14%). The fruit fades a bit quickly on the finish, leaving some drying tannins behind, so serve with rare beef or lamb.\n57007\tAustralia\t\t88\t27\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKangarilla Road 2008 Shiraz-Viognier (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz-Viognier\tKangarilla Road\tLT_90_Points\tThere's a healthy 8% Viognier in the blend, but this wine doesn't come across as overtly apricotty. Instead, it delivers big blueberries and blackberries on the nose and hints of plum and cola, with just a hint of raisining. It's full bodied—almost viscous in texture—balanced by crisp acids on the finish. Drink now-2016.\n38065\tAustralia\tVat 47\t89\t50\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\t\t\tTyrrell's 2000 Vat 47 Chardonnay (Hunter Valley)\tChardonnay\tTyrrell's\tLT_90_Points\tA very nice wine that's zesty and fresh in the mouth, and deep gold in color, the Vat 47 offers bright yellow fruit flavors, with light vanilla, toast and citrus accents. Nose is alternately perfumey and toasty. Tasted twice.\n94712\tAustralia\t\t91\t39\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJosef Chromy 2013 Pinot Noir (Tasmania)\tPinot Noir\tJosef Chromy\tGT_90_Points\tSome whole-bunch fermentation is reflected in a vegetal hint on the nose, but otherwise this is a fruit-driven youngster, bursting with lively red berries. Hints of toasted coconut, vanilla and mocha from French oak add complexity to this medium-bodied, supple wine. The tannins firm up on the finish, suggesting mid-term cellaring; drink 2017–2023.\n92888\tAustralia\t\t92\t35\tSouth Australia\tLimestone Coast\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSt Mary's 2013 Shiraz (Limestone Coast)\tShiraz\tSt Mary's\tGT_90_Points\tLimestone Coast encompasses the Padthaway, Coonawarra and Wrattonbully regions (and the undemarcated bits in between), so it's a larger region, but one still focused on quality. This wine combines notes of eucalyptus and red fruit with toasted coconut-like oak. It's got a silky texture and a long finish. Drink now through 2025.\n95387\tAustralia\tCitrine\t86\t17\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGemtree 2008 Citrine Chardonnay (McLaren Vale)\tChardonnay\tGemtree\tLT_90_Points\tOn the lean, citrusy side, but the flavors of pineapple and lemon are married to hints of vanilla and smoke for added complexity. Could use a touch more flesh, but some will enjoy the crispness.\n9017\tAustralia\tThe Reserve\t88\t11\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\t\t\tYellow Tail 2006 The Reserve Merlot (South Eastern Australia)\tMerlot\tYellow Tail\tLT_90_Points\tThe opaque eggplant hue of this stunning value promises much—and what's in the glass delivers. Prominent oaky notes are layered over plum and high-toned floral aromas. Dense and voluptuous on the palate, with chewy tannins, this is a seriously ambitious wine that could benefit from a year or two in the bottle.\n76960\tAustralia\tOmrah\t91\t20\tWestern Australia\tGreat Southern\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPlantagenet 2008 Omrah Shiraz (Great Southern)\tShiraz\tPlantagenet\tGT_90_Points\tA step up from the winery's entry-level Hazard Hill bottling, the 2008 Omrah Shiraz is another terrific value. It takes plummy fruit and cedary oak, then ups the ante with complex notes of smoked meat and leather while silky tannins line the long finish. Drink now–2020.\n13571\tAustralia\t\t84\t28\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHamelin Bay 2000 Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tHamelin Bay\tLT_90_Points\tWith a nose full of buttered popcorn and vanilla, it's clear that much if not all of this wine was barrel-fermented and aged, maybe a tad too much. The vanilla and toast flavors partially obscure pretty white peach fruit.\n89924\tAustralia\tDry Red Wine No. 2\t94\t95\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYarra Yering 2008 Dry Red Wine No. 2 Shiraz-Viognier (Yarra Valley)\tShiraz-Viognier\tYarra Yering\tGT_90_Points\tDry Red No. 2 is virtually all Shiraz, though small amounts of Viognier, Marsanne and Mataro are often included. The 2008 displays slightly vegetal shadings of capsicum and tomato that may prove controversial, but there's ample cassis as well, rounded out by a cedar note. Its medium weight and delicate, silky texture combine to impart those ineffable qualities of grace and elegance.\n86884\tAustralia\tOld Winery - Hunter Valley/McLaren Vale\t87\t14\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTyrrell's 2001 Old Winery - Hunter Valley/McLaren Vale Chardonnay (Hunter Valley)\tChardonnay\tTyrrell's\tLT_90_Points\tUnderstated and less ripe than many Australian Chardonnays, which makes for a nice change of pace when tasting, but also a leaner, more austere style dominated by citrus flavors. This atypical Aussie Chard could even be paired with shellfish.\n65014\tAustralia\t\t88\t20\tAustralia Other\tAustralia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tInnocent Bystander 2007 Chardonnay (Australia)\tChardonnay\tInnocent Bystander\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine provides plenty of drinking pleasure for a moderate tariff. Smoke, toast and vanilla aromas speak to barrel fermentation and aging, while the apple, pear, pineapple and citrus flavors show off top-notch fruit. It's all put together in a balanced, medium-weight package that finishes clean and fresh.\n55377\tAustralia\tAre You Game?\t88\t17\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFowles Wine 2015 Are You Game? Pinot Grigio (Victoria)\tPinot Grigio\tFowles Wine\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine's pinkish-coppery hue suggests a bit of skin contact, as does the silky texture on the palate.

Then add complex rancio notes, plus maple syrup and molasses. It's full, round and harmonious, wonderfully rich yet without any sense of heaviness and long and bright on the finish.\n117983\tAustralia\tRSW\t90\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWirra Wirra 2013 RSW Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tWirra Wirra\tGT_90_Points\tFull bodied, muscular and intense, this brooding Shiraz is built for the cellar.

Toasty, grilled-bread notes mark the nose, while the palate unfurls into a mix of peach, melon and citrus flavors that finish clean and refreshing. Drink this well balanced wine over the next few years.\n75362\tAustralia\tOracle\t91\t70\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKilikanoon 2006 Oracle Shiraz (Clare Valley)\tShiraz\tKilikanoon\tGT_90_Points\tDark and chocolaty in style, with hints of earth and espresso oozing in. This is a big, heavy, fudge-like Shiraz that comes across as impressive for its concentration if not for any sense of elegance or finesse. Might improve with aging, but might not; a gamble, so drink it over the next couple of years.\n56451\tAustralia\tLeston\t91\t20\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHoward Park 2004 Leston Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tHoward Park\tGT_90_Points\tHoward Park's single-vineyard wines continue to impress for their value and consistency. The 2004 Leston is a richly textured, velvety Cab, marked by earthy, loamy scents and classic cassis, vanilla and tobacco flavors.

The flavors are earthy and dark, reminiscent of burnt wood and roasted meat, finally ending on an espresso note.\n39121\tAustralia\t\t89\t22\tVictoria\tBeechworth\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBrokenwood 2014 Pinot Noir (Beechworth)\tPinot Noir\tBrokenwood\tLT_90_Points\tSince Brokenwood's Hunter Valley location isn't ideal for Pinot Noir, it sources the grapes for this wine from Beechworth (inland Victoria). This is a fine, crisp wine for early drinking. Lacy floral and cherry aromas lead the way, followed by tart flavors reminiscent of berry zinger tea.\n33627\tAustralia\tThe Galvo Garage\t91\t29\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2009 The Galvo Garage Red (Adelaide)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tPrimarily Cabernet Sauvignon (the balance is Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc), this is full bodied, lush and richly textured. Cassis, blackberry, vanilla and tobacco leaf notes give this a convincingly Bordeaux-styled profile, although much riper and plusher. Drink now–2023.\n124061\tAustralia\tFinisterre\t92\t30\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRobert Oatley 2015 Finisterre Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tRobert Oatley\tGT_90_Points\tWhite peach and toasted grain aromas ease gently into a plump, custardy mouthful of melon and stone fruit. Balanced nuttiness frames the wine, giving it just enough structure on the elegant, plush finish. Drink now–2020.\n65487\tAustralia\tFrank Potts Red Wine\t90\t27\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBleasdale 2005 Frank Potts Red Wine Red (Langhorne Creek)\tCabernet Blend\tBleasdale\tGT_90_Points\tThere's plenty of vanillin and cedary oak in this wine, but it's easily balanced by impressive levels of cassis and blackberry fruit. The texture in the mouth is creamy and supple, and the finish is long and vanilla-laden but silky, without any harsh wood tannins. The blend is 89% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec, with bits of Petit Verdot and Merlot.\n35391\tAustralia\tThe Beast\t92\t75\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHentley Farm 2007 The Beast Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tHentley Farm\tGT_90_Points\tThe 2007 is full bodied and rich, but not really Beast-like at this stage of its evolution. The texture is creamy, the tannins nearly silky on the long finish. Flavors of blackberry, mocha and black olive linger.

From vines planted in 1964, this is a rich, full-bodied and creamy-textured wine, with complex notes of smoke, vanilla, plum and roasted meat. Approachable now because of its lushness, it should drink well for at least the next several years.\n94834\tAustralia\tBlack Cluster\t89\t35\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWyndham Estate 2003 Black Cluster Shiraz (Hunter Valley)\tShiraz\tWyndham Estate\tLT_90_Points\tNot that much Hunter Shiraz makes it to the U.S. these days, but this bottling from Wyndham Estate is a nice example. It shows rather clean winemaking, with strong vanilla and cedar notes from barrel aging to go alongside blueberry and blackberry fruit. Only mildly tannic, so it's approachable now, but should age through at least 2012.\n15209\tAustralia\tKevin John\t94\t109\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCullen 2013 Kevin John Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tCullen\tGT_90_Points\tIt's a shame only the equivalent of one barrel of this wine was exported to the U.S., as it means only a handful of people here will get to experience it. It's perhaps the closest thing to great white Burgundy to come from Australia; subtly smoky at first, like grilled white peaches, adding hints of lime and vanilla on the palate. It's plump and slightly creamy in texture, but finishes with crisp, acidic verve.

It's plump and round in the mouth, but refreshingly modest in alcohol (13.1%), finishing clean. The winery says it's made from Fragola, which turns out to be an American variety known as Isabella. Imported by Margaret River Wines.\n78714\tAustralia\tThe Contours Museum Reserve\t93\t45\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPewsey Vale 2011 The Contours Museum Reserve Riesling (Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tPewsey Vale\tGT_90_Points\tThis release deserves some sort of award for consistency, year in and year out. The 2011 is light to medium in body and long, zesty and vibrant on the finish. Aromas and flavors of bergamot, honey (although the wine is completely dry) and toast are classic aged Eden Valley Riesling.

A medium-sized wine on the palate, this Shiraz reprises the familiar red berries-plum-earth-oak theme, but does it well.\n123423\tAustralia\tZdar\t87\t47\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJosef Chromy 2006 Zdar Pinot Noir (Tasmania)\tPinot Noir\tJosef Chromy\tLT_90_Points\tLavish vanilla and cedar nearly take over this wine, leaving just enough dark, plummy fruit to peek through, yet the wine remains true to its varietal roots in its silky mouthfeel. A bitter coffee note sneaks in on the finish. Seems ready to drink.\n70123\tAustralia\tLadies Who Shoot Their Lunch\t89\t35\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFowles Wine 2014 Ladies Who Shoot Their Lunch Riesling (Victoria)\tRiesling\tFowles Wine\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine, which comes from thin, granitic soils, is lean, taut and dry.

It's soft and sweet, balanced a bit by citrusy acids on the finish.\n36033\tAustralia\tPure Estate\t86\t11\tAustralia Other\tCentral Ranges\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAnthropology 2009 Pure Estate Shiraz (Central Ranges)\tShiraz\tAnthropology\tLT_90_Points\tThe oak treatment stands out a little in this wine, imparting a dusty, wood-smoke component as well as plenty of vanilla. The cherry fruit is otherwise nicely presented, with ample weight and a touch of creaminess to the texture.\n33723\tAustralia\tPeace Family Vineyard\t81\t8\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAndrew Peace 2006 Peace Family Vineyard Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)\tChardonnay\tAndrew Peace\tLT_90_Points\tMuted on the nose, with flavors of apple and white gumdrops, and finishing with hints of butter and anise.\n81387\tAustralia\t\t81\t8\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDiamond Ridge 2000 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)\tShiraz\tDiamond Ridge\tLT_90_Points\tThis lightweight wine seems prematurely aged, with aromas and flavors of damp earth and cremini mushrooms. —J.C.\n30978\tAustralia\t\t87\t30\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAramis 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tAramis\tLT_90_Points\tPerhaps this wine just needs some additional cellaring, as the finish is long enough to suggest promise, but this particular bottle was in a cranky stage, showing lots of toasted oak and coffee-like aromas and tart acidity. The tannins seem ripe, so it's worth trying again in a year or two.\n30861\tAustralia\t\t87\t22\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\t\t\tHamelin Bay 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Margaret River)\tSauvignon Blanc\tHamelin Bay\tLT_90_Points\tThe bouquet starts off snappy and clean, but with time some pungent sea foam and green-bean aromas arise. Basic pear, melon and green herbs make up the flavor profile, while the short finish, though offering ample pepper and mineral, is lacking in fruit.\n40226\tAustralia\tdB Sparkling Brut\t85\t10\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDe Bortoli NV dB Sparkling Brut Sparkling (South Eastern Australia)\tSparkling Blend\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tLight and fresh, this 100% Chardonnay sparkler features slightly gingery, briny, biscuity aromas and crisp, balanced finish.

Shows good density and richness, ending on notes of cofee and chocolate. Drink now–2013.\n124785\tAustralia\tThe Last Ditch\t86\t25\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale-Adelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2008 The Last Ditch Viognier (McLaren Vale-Adelaide Hills)\tViognier\tD'Arenberg\tLT_90_Points\tBarrel fermented in older oak, but this wine is still marked by oak and lees, with a slightly toasty, custardy edge to the melon and nectarine aromas and flavors. This medium-bodied Viognier then picks up hints of coffee and chocolate on the finish. Drink now.\n49180\tAustralia\t\t86\t20\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\t\t\tElysian Fields 2001 Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tElysian Fields\tLT_90_Points\tHas a nice citrus-pear core, but the fruit wears a strange faux-sweetness (really, it tastes like saccharine) that was a little offputting. Still, it's a nice wine, with medium body and nice resiny and creamy notes on the nose.\n114276\tAustralia\tReserve\t91\t24\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSidewood 2008 Reserve Syrah (Adelaide Hills)\tSyrah\tSidewood\tGT_90_Points\tInterestingly, Sidewood's 2008 Reserve Shiraz comes in considerably lower in alcohol than the regular bottling. It features a complex interplay of herb, spice and olive that gives it a stylistic resemblance resemblance to northern Rhône Syrahs. The tannins are silky, the finish long and balanced. Drink now–2018.\n61395\tAustralia\tBasalt Block\t90\t15\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHope Estate 2013 Basalt Block Shiraz (Hunter Valley)\tShiraz\tHope Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThis is already showing some evolution in its color, displaying some lightening at its rim. The aromas are floral and tea-like, with subtle cinnamon and spice shadings, and the flavors follow along, resembling Wild Berry Zinger tea. It's medium in weight, with silky tannins and a softly dusty finish.\n103701\tAustralia\tThe Y Series\t90\t12\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2014 The Y Series Viognier (South Australia)\tViognier\tYalumba\tGT_90_Points\tA terrific deal, this is as varietally correct and rich a Viognier as you'll find for the price. Honeysuckle and apricot notes are carried by a slightly oily texture, yet the wine finishes long and elegantly. Vegan. Drink now.\n62856\tAustralia\t\t84\t30\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\t\t\tBalnaves of Coonawarra 1999 Chardonnay (Coonawarra)\tChardonnay\tBalnaves of Coonawarra\tLT_90_Points\tFeels rather full in the mouth, but the flavors aren't as big as its body. Dry, citrusy notes (lemon peel, lemonade) play on the palate and the finish. Nose offers lots of toast and butterscotch.\n96828\tAustralia\tFarm to Table\t85\t17\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFowles Wine 2014 Farm to Table Sauvignon Blanc (Victoria)\tSauvignon Blanc\tFowles Wine\tLT_90_Points\tLean, tart, angular and edgy, this delivers just what some people are looking for in a Sauvignon Blanc. The fruit is tinged with green throughout, focusing in on lime zest, although there is some yellow plum. It's crisp and clean on the finish.\n60160\tAustralia\t\t84\t12\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tRazor's Edge 2006 Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tRazor's Edge\tLT_90_Points\tRoast beef and black cherry notes open this juicy example from South Australia.

Which is not to say it's a big wine, but it does offer plenty of mixed berry fruit and hints of chocolate in a medium-bodied wine. Picks up some savory olive and coffee notes on the mouthwatering finish.\n77168\tAustralia\tSV\t90\t28\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLoom 2013 SV Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills)\tPinot Noir\tLoom\tGT_90_Points\tIt's refreshing to see another importer take a chance on Pinot Noir from the Adelaide Hills, a region that can reliably ripen the variety at reasonable crop loads. This is a rounder, more supple style of Pinot than most from Australia, with cola, spice and cherry notes reminiscent of Dr. Pepper, or of some Pinots from California's Russian River Valley. Drink now–2020.\n94852\tAustralia\tThe Pict\t91\t75\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2012 The Pict Mataro (Barossa Valley)\tMataro\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tImagine a dark, smoky espresso bar, lined with leather banquettes. Mouthwatering scents of grilled meat waft in from a back garden. This is a full-bodied, plush rendering of Mourvèdre that doesn't show much freshness or fruit yet still caresses the palate.\n72538\tAustralia\tSexton Vineyard\t87\t35\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGiant Steps 2010 Sexton Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)\tPinot Noir\tGiant Steps\tLT_90_Points\tA supple, easygoing Pinot Noir, with modest weight in the mouth but assertive notes of cola, earth and cherries. The aromas are slightly perfumed and confected, but the flavors are sturdier and more savory in nature. Drink now.\n32305\tAustralia\tBook Ends\t88\t21\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWest Cape Howe 2005 Book Ends Cabernet Sauvignon (Western Australia)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tWest Cape Howe\tLT_90_Points\tThis Cabernet fits the steakhouse red formula to a T. Ripe, lusty fruit—blackberry in this case—is matched by a big whack of vanillin oak. It's not the most complex wine, but offers plenty of full-bodied, softly tannic flavor. Drink now–2012.\n54694\tAustralia\tThe Lackey\t86\t15\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tKilikanoon 2006 The Lackey Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tKilikanoon\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a fresh and elegant take, a good choice for those who find some Shiraz to be heavy-handed. Spice and cedar scents lead to a medium-bodied palate with raspberry and plum fruit couched in velvety tannins. The medium finish is shot through with plum notes. Drink up or keep for a year.\n29545\tAustralia\t\t84\t8\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJacob's Creek 2010 Moscato (South Eastern Australia)\tMoscato\tJacob's Creek\tLT_90_Points\tVery floral, citrusy and perfumed upfront, retaining that lemony edge to help the retained carbon dioxide balance the inherent sweetness.

This one clocks in at 15.7%, but doesn't seem hot or heavy, just mouthfilling and round. Blueberry and blackberry fruit lead the way, but they're joined by earthier notes of black olive, coffee and tree bark. Drink now–2010.\n108979\tAustralia\tBreathing Space\t85\t\tAustralia Other\tAustralia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tEvans & Tate 2015 Breathing Space Pinot Grigio (Australia)\tPinot Grigio\tEvans & Tate\tLT_90_Points\tThis medium-bodied wine doesn't show much of the variety's mouthfeel, but does show clean, dry flavors of melon and citrus.

Forty percent of the base wine is barrel-fermented, imparting a rich, cashew character that's augmented by two years of aging on lees. It's a complex, medium-bodied wine that's a departure from most New World sparklers.\n72984\tAustralia\tSucette\t89\t59\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\t\t\tAn Approach to Relaxation 2015 Sucette Grenache (Barossa)\tGrenache\tAn Approach to Relaxation\tLT_90_Points\tGrown on sandy soils, this cherry-hued Grenache offers up juicy watermelon and red fruit notes, with vanilla, white pepper and a dash of green herbs.

The latest vintage release is remarkably fresh and zesty, bursting with green apple and citrus, with just hints of toasted brioche. This light- to medium-bodied wine is a blend of 53% Chardonnay and 47% Pinot Noir.\n106478\tAustralia\tGSM Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvèdre\t85\t10\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tOxford Landing 2008 GSM Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvèdre Red (South Australia)\tRhône-style Red Blend\tOxford Landing\tLT_90_Points\tThis blend of 45% Grenache, 28% Shiraz and 27% Mourvèdre does show a trace of heat in its finish, but is otherwise a pleasant, medium-bodied sipper at a realistic price. Tart, slightly minty cherries feature undercurrents of chocolate and coffee, turning crisp and lemony on the finish. Drink now.\n72763\tAustralia\tDiana Madeline\t93\t109\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCullen 2013 Diana Madeline Red (Margaret River)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tCullen\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a wonderful counterpoint to Vasse Felix's Heytesbury. Where that wine is lush, this is more austere, with restrained, Bordeaux-reminiscent sensibilities. Smoky, grilled elements frame cassis and mint, finishing with classic firm tannins and admirable length. Drink 2023–2035, although the back label suggests “up to a further 30 years.”\n41214\tAustralia\tDeen de Bortoli Vat 1\t84\t13\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDe Bortoli 2006 Deen de Bortoli Vat 1 Petite Sirah (South Eastern Australia)\tPetite Sirah\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tThis is nominally a step up from De Bortoli's dB Selection Petite Sirah, but this fresh, directly fruity wine doesn't seem to offer much beyond jammy fruit.

The disparate elements converge in a harmonious finish that invites you back for another sip.\n128434\tAustralia\tAncestor Vine 1850\t94\t90\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCirillo 2011 Ancestor Vine 1850 Grenache (Barossa Valley)\tGrenache\tCirillo\tGT_90_Points\tA remarkable effort, especially considering how difficult the 2011 vintage was in South Australia. Floral notes emerge on the nose, dressing up hints of raspberry compote, while the medium- to full-bodied palate delivers raspberries, cherries, cinnamon, clove and pepper. The tannins on the finish are fine and silky. Drink now–2025.\n83816\tAustralia\tBishop\t93\t37\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGlaetzer 2013 Bishop Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tGlaetzer\tGT_90_Points\tThis has gone up in price over the years, but it's still a solid, relatively affordable example of Barossa Valley Shiraz. This is youthful and edgy, with meaty, savory notes accenting mixed berries and a hint of mint. The finish is a bit chewy right now, but mouthcoating and long.\n628\tAustralia\tAlluvial Fans\t92\t35\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKangarilla Road 2012 Alluvial Fans Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tKangarilla Road\tGT_90_Points\tThis plush, full-bodied wine is already delicious, delivering wave after wave of savory fruit flavor, something like soy-marinated, char-grilled beef. Tannins are supple enough to make this wine drinkable now, yet plentiful enough to suggest ample cellaring potential.

Cassis and cedar scents give way to dark, chocolaty flavors. There's not a lot of bright fruit or nuance, but it will ably partner simple grilled meats.\n34157\tAustralia\tStonemason\t84\t12\tSouth Australia\tCurrency Creek\t\t\t\tBallast Stone Estate Wines 2007 Stonemason Shiraz (Currency Creek)\tShiraz\tBallast Stone Estate Wines\tLT_90_Points\tHonest and straightforward, with black cherry candy and strawberry fruit upfront that give way to flavors of mixed berries and pepper in the mouth. This wine has a burly structure, with gripping tannins, firm acid and good palate length though it drops a bit short at the end. A fine choice for a casual barbecue. Drink before 2011.\n124073\tAustralia\tKillerman's Run\t92\t20\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKilikanoon 2014 Killerman's Run Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tKilikanoon\tGT_90_Points\tLess effusive on the nose than the Mort's Block, this boasts notes of tangerine zest and lemon. This dry, medium-bodied Riesling hints at riper fruit flavors yet stays resolutely citrusy through the long, electric finish.\n77691\tAustralia\t\t87\t19\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\t\t\tPipers Brook Vineyard Estate 2002 Riesling (Tasmania)\tRiesling\tPipers Brook Vineyard Estate\tLT_90_Points\tA fresh and crisp, though unusual, wine. It has pleasing flavors yet tastes like it's made from flowers rather than fruit. There's jasmine, honeysuckle—you name it—on both the nose and the palate. Lean in the mouth, with a hint of apple skin toward the finish.\n35336\tAustralia\tThe Benbournie\t93\t140\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJim Barry 2002 The Benbournie Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tJim Barry\tGT_90_Points\tFor a late-release 2002, this is still very youthful, packing layers of rich cassis and blackberry fruit into a soft jacket of vanilla, cedar and toasted coconut. It's full-bodied, lush and velvety—a simply terrific Cabernet that should prove to have excellent aging potential as well. Drink now–2020.\n13343\tAustralia\t\t86\t13\tNew South Wales\tRiverina\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tNugan Family Estates 2006 Chardonnay (Riverina)\tChardonnay\tNugan Family Estates\tLT_90_Points\tThis is unapologetically warm-climate Chardonnay, featuring tropical fruit, plenty of weight and texture and a whack of vanilla and cut-wood character. It's a broad, full-bodied wine that pulls together on the finish, ending with notes of pineapple and citrus.\n1909\tAustralia\t\t88\t22\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tShingleback 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tShingleback\tLT_90_Points\tA real crowd-pleaser, the 2005 Shingleback may not have quite the complexity of the 2004, but it's still a fun, approachable wine. Cola and coffee notes accent plum and blackberry flavors, while the broad texture coats the mouth with soft tannins. Drink now–2012.\n94416\tAustralia\tEstate Grown\t88\t30\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDe Bortoli 2007 Estate Grown Sauvignon (Yarra Valley)\tSauvignon\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tThis medium-bodied wine is a stylistic departure from the stereotypical Aussie stainless-steel Sauvignon Blanc, being fermented and aged in old French oak barrels for eight months. The result is a citrusy wine with greater depth and richer texture, even some leesy, slightly toasty notes that complement rather than overwhelm the fruit. Drink now–2010, but it could surprise and develop even more interest over time.\n56443\tAustralia\tCyril Henschke\t92\t100\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenschke 2003 Cyril Henschke Cabernet Sauvignon (Eden Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tHenschke\tGT_90_Points\tFrom a somewhat difficult vintage, Stephen and Prue Henschke have turned out a wonderful Cab. Eucalyptus, tobacco and cherry aromas lead the way, followed by flavors that add a deep undercurrent of cassis. It's a big, thickly textured wine, with a long, berry-inflected finish. Not that tannic, it should nevertheless drink well through at least 2015.\n2587\tAustralia\tPoison Hill Vineyard\t90\t35\tWestern Australia\tFrankland River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFrankland Estate 2012 Poison Hill Vineyard Riesling (Frankland River)\tRiesling\tFrankland Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThe most aromatically complex of the FE 2012 Rieslings, the Poison Hill offers beguiling scents of tangerine sherbet and Earl Grey tea. It's almost too perfumy for its soft, medium-bodied structure and slightly dusty-textured finish, but those floral elements are also its appeal. Drink now–2020+.\n128002\tAustralia\t\t92\t25\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tShaw and Smith 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)\tSauvignon Blanc\tShaw and Smith\tGT_90_Points\tThe best Sauvignon Blanc yet from Shaw & Smith, the 2009 boasts terrifically fragrant aromas of passion fruit and pink grapefruit. It's intense and long, easily the qualitative equal of its top Kiwi cousins and better than most.

Mint and green herbs mingle with potpourri, juicy fruit, and charred oak characters. Tannins are tightly wound at the moment, but the wine is well balanced and here for the long haul. Drink 2020–2032.\n97342\tAustralia\t\t88\t16\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRingbolt 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tRingbolt\tLT_90_Points\tA Western Australia offshoot of the Yalumba empire, Ringbolt's 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon offers solid quality at a reasonable price. It's medium-bodied and elegant, with prominent herbal notes balanced by cassis and chocolate. Long on the finish, where dried spice and vanilla notes emerge.

Give it 2-3 years to develop additional complexity, then drink it over the next 7-8 years.\n128744\tAustralia\tEstate Label\t90\t18\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\t\t\tWakefield 2016 Estate Label Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tWakefield\tGT_90_Points\tPale gold in color, this wine leads with notes of fresh apples, blossoms and honeycomb.

Yes, it's a bit of a throwback in its size and plushness, but there's no denying its appealing cherry and raspberry fruit, hint of charred oak and slightly creamy texture. Drink now–2018.\n26517\tAustralia\tEstate Vineyard\t93\t154\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGiaconda 2014 Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Victoria)\tChardonnay\tGiaconda\tGT_90_Points\tMusky, spicy notes of pineapple and clove set the stage, expanding on the palate alongside waves of cinnamon, vanilla and peach.

Finishes with more tropical fruit and some white pepper. Try it with Asian cuisine—this plus a ginger-based sauce makes for a good match.\n83067\tAustralia\tOld Winery\t88\t14\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\t\t\tTyrrell's 2002 Old Winery Chardonnay (Hunter Valley)\tChardonnay\tTyrrell's\tLT_90_Points\tA fresh, food-friendly wine and a good value, the Old Winery Chardonnay has passion fruit, papaya and fresh herb flavors, with a light nougat aroma on the nose. On the palate, it's gravelly, and maybe a little spritzy. It's not a full, creamy, toasty blockbuster—but that's part of its charm.\n70638\tAustralia\tSingle Vineyard\t86\t15\tWestern Australia\tPemberton\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFonty's Pool 2006 Single Vineyard Viognier (Pemberton)\tViognier\tFonty's Pool\tLT_90_Points\tThis starts off a little reductive, with tarry, burnt-rubber aromas that are frankly offputting. But a aeration works wonders, and this wine opens up to reveal hints of toasted almonds, melon and citrus, all supported by a crisp finish. Imported by American Wine Distributors.\n94444\tAustralia\tMagnus\t88\t12\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeasingham 2006 Magnus Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tLeasingham\tLT_90_Points\tFrom its floral, lime-driven aromas to its citrus and baked-apple flavors, this is a textbook Riesling.

In this case, the wine is five years past the vintage but still seems rather vegetal, showing ample green bell-pepper notes alongside tart citrus flavors.\n65169\tAustralia\tThe Stump Jump\t85\t13\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2015 The Stump Jump Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)\tSauvignon Blanc\tD'Arenberg\tLT_90_Points\tGreen beans and grapefruit mark the nose; nectarine, pineapple and beans appear on the palate. At just 12.6% abv, it's reasonably plump and a bit sweet-tasting, making for a slightly disjointed package.\n92620\tAustralia\tSexton Vineyard\t91\t35\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGiant Steps 2009 Sexton Vineyard Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)\tChardonnay\tGiant Steps\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a nicely put together Chardonnay, offering enough creamy richness to balance the wine's crisp acids.

Dusty tannins and a balanced but tight feel suggest a few years in the cellar. Drink 2010–2020.\n84921\tAustralia\t\t90\t21\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tVasse River 2005 Shiraz (Margaret River)\tShiraz\tVasse River\tGT_90_Points\tOffers up a nice blend of savory and fruity elements, marrying marinated beef and ripe cherries and framing them in vanilla-scented oak.

The palate is of medium weight, with a viscous texture and a good lick of acidity to keep things fresh, but the oak is a little flashy, particularly on the finish.\n64809\tAustralia\tYellow Label\t85\t12\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWolf Blass 2009 Yellow Label Chardonnay (South Australia)\tChardonnay\tWolf Blass\tLT_90_Points\tKnown more for its red wines, Wolf Blass nevertheless makes a creditable Chardonnay for $12. hints of vanilla and toasted almond mark the nose, while the fruit flavors veer toward citrus and stay there, turning lemony on the finish.\n12972\tAustralia\t\t84\t14\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tShoofly 2012 Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)\tPinot Noir\tShoofly\tLT_90_Points\tThis plump, medium-bodied Pinot Noir lacks for fruit, instead showcasing savory notes of underbrush, smoke and roasted vegetables.

Acidity on the palate is searing and tannins are soft, not giving quite enough support. The fruit is on the sour side and the oak a little bitter.\n122628\tAustralia\tGiants Creek\t84\t17\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRosemount 1999 Giants Creek Chardonnay (Hunter Valley)\tChardonnay\tRosemount\tLT_90_Points\tBig butterscotch—aromas and flavors—come close to drowning out some of the finer nuances of this wine, which include green apples, citrus fruits and dried spices.

Probably best over the next year or so.\n10831\tAustralia\tObsidian\t90\t50\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGemtree 2004 Obsidian Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tGemtree\tGT_90_Points\tGemtree's Obsidian Shiraz ratchets up the intensity from its usual offerings, adding structure and richness to straight-ahead aromas and flavors of cherries, coffee and vanilla. The wood sticks out a little on the finish, so give it another year or two in the bottle, then drink it over the next 10.\n124365\tAustralia\t\t88\t17\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMad Fish 2015 Chardonnay (Western Australia)\tChardonnay\tMad Fish\tLT_90_Points\tPeach and pear fruit come together in this simple, fruity, but satisfying Chardonnay from Western Australia. It's moderately rich and full in body, but nicely silky in texture.\n129389\tAustralia\t\t85\t5\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBanrock Station 2006 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)\tShiraz\tBanrock Station\tLT_90_Points\tBanrock Station's 2006 Shiraz is a throwback to the kind of super value Australian wines used to provide with more regularity. For $5, consumers get a decently textured, supple wine with plenty of forward blueberry and plum fruit and touches of chocolate and pepper. Look for it by the glass or buy it by the case for entertaining on a budget.\n67728\tAustralia\t\t89\t9\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tOxford Landing 2014 Viognier (South Australia)\tViognier\tOxford Landing\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine may not be quite as rich or expressive as the other Viogniers in the Yalumba stable, but it's still an attractive effort. Pineapple and apricot flavors pick up hints of gingery spice on the vibrant finish. Drink now.\n90529\tAustralia\tDescendant\t92\t125\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2013 Descendant Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz-Viognier\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tFull bodied, creamy and rich, this wine will undoubtedly please Torbreck fans and provide another piece of ammo for critics. Tasted blind, I wrote, “Torbreck-like nose of lifted spice and stewed berries.” There's a hint of mint as well. Mixed berries and brown sugar notes mingle easily on the palate, while a touch of dried fruit (not a positive) creeps in on the finish. Drink now–2025.\n87567\tAustralia\tLois Blanc de Blancs\t85\t20\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tThe Lane NV Lois Blanc de Blancs  (Adelaide Hills)\tChampagne Blend\tThe Lane\tLT_90_Points\tThis fruit-driven wine doesn't show the complexity of much lees aging, but satisfies with its clean, refreshing flavors of pineapple, peach and melon. It's light in body and nearly dry.\n44826\tAustralia\tNelwood Station Bulldozer\t86\t12\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tNelwood Wines 2004 Nelwood Station Bulldozer Red (South Australia)\tRed Blend\tNelwood Wines\tLT_90_Points\tYou might not know it from the name, but this is a bit of a critter wine, as Bulldozer is a nickname for the hairy-nosed wombat. In any event, it's a step up from much of the competition, offering sturdy cassis flavors tinged with pepper and herbs and a clean, mouthwatering finish. Imported by MHW, Ltd.\n35340\tAustralia\tSt. Andrews\t93\t50\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWakefield 2001 St. Andrews Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tWakefield\tGT_90_Points\tMade in the winery's classically savory style, this flagship Cabernet shows a touch of bricking at the rim and some maturing aromas and flavors of tobacco, cedar and earth. It's broad and mouthfilling, creamy in texture yet not obviously fruity, finishing with lush, soft tannins and a touch of hickory smoke. Drink now–2015.\n53405\tAustralia\tAndreas Premium Polish Hill River\t90\t40\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPauletts 2007 Andreas Premium Polish Hill River Shiraz (Clare Valley)\tShiraz\tPauletts\tGT_90_Points\tThis medium- to full-bodied red features bright fruit accented by oak. Vanilla strongly marks the nose, yet cherry and raspberry also come through, tinged with baking spices. Crisp and firm on the finish; try pairing with rich cuts of red meat.\n38688\tAustralia\t\t92\t40\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGreenstone 2012 Shiraz (Heathcote)\tShiraz\tGreenstone\tGT_90_Points\tThe quality of wines emerging from the partnership of Italian winemaking consultant Alberto Antonini, Australian viticulturist Mark Walpole and U.K.-based Master of Wine David Gleave is impressive. This Shiraz boasts complex aromas of campfire, cracked pepper and cassis married to ample weight and firm, yet silky, texture. The balance is spot-on, being neither too heavy nor too light, with a crisp, long finish. Drink now–2020, possibly beyond.\n71583\tAustralia\tBush Block\t88\t26\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGroom 2008 Bush Block Zinfandel (Barossa Valley)\tZinfandel\tGroom\tLT_90_Points\tNo doubt informed by winemaker Daryl Groom's California experience, this is a fine example of Australian Zinfandel, marrying briary berry fruit with subtle herbal notes and hints of vanilla, cinnamon and clove. The tannins are soft, yet the wine remains fresh on the finish. Drink now–2013.\n2517\tAustralia\tRunRig\t94\t225\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2010 RunRig Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz-Viognier\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tA perplexing wine to evaluate, the 2010 RunRig (97% Shiraz and 3% Viognier) evolves rapidly once poured, going from slightly stewed and overoaked to a wine that shows considerable class within 20 minutes or so. Aromas and flavors of brown sugar, mocha and roasted meat give way to raspberry compote, while the creamy texture and supple tannins conceal the wine's high alcohol level with ease.\n49914\tAustralia\tTradition\t88\t25\tVictoria\tPyrenees\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSyan 2005 Tradition Red (Pyrenees)\tRed Blend\tSyan\tLT_90_Points\tThis easy-to-drink, medium-bodied red blends 31% Merlot, 28% Shiraz, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Cabernet Franc, then adds lashings of toasty, vanilla-scented oak. The result is a supple wine redolent of plums, vanilla and baking spices that finishes soft and creamy-smooth. Ready to drink now.\n119811\tAustralia\tThe Magnet Generation Series\t90\t30\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMr. Riggs 2014 The Magnet Generation Series Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tMr. Riggs\tGT_90_Points\tUnderstated plum, earth and spice aromas give an indication that this is not a casual, fruity Grenache. It is warm and supple, yet features enough dried-spice complexity to merit slow sipping and even savoring the lingering finish.\n64263\tAustralia\tReserve\t91\t60\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYering Station 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)\tChardonnay\tYering Station\tGT_90_Points\tThis is made in a full-blown style, with ripe peaches married to grilled nuts and plenty of toasty oak. Yet despite all of the fruit and oak intensity, there's crispness and structure as well, giving a sense of balance and elegance to the lingering citrus and cashew finish.\n10835\tAustralia\tEight Songs\t90\t38\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPeter Lehmann 2004 Eight Songs Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tPeter Lehmann\tGT_90_Points\tMatured 18 months in French oak, this rich, velvety-textured Shiraz shows plenty of vanilla influence as a result. But there's also plenty of ripe blackberry fruit, and the overall impression is of a lush, fruity wine that would make a lovely steakhouse red.\n44454\tAustralia\t\t90\t15\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRed Knot 2014 Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tRed Knot\tGT_90_Points\tAsphalt, licorice and espresso mark the nose of this medium-bodied, juicy Shiraz. The flavors are brighter, hinting at rhubarb, yet still retaining a dark, tarry edge. Drink this mouthwatering wine over the next few years.\n128983\tAustralia\tMoritz\t93\t60\tSouth Australia\tClarendon\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tClarendon Hills 2008 Moritz Syrah (Clarendon)\tSyrah\tClarendon Hills\tGT_90_Points\tOf all the Clarendon Hills 2008 Syrahs, the Moritz probably offers the best value. It's plummy, dark and intense, with savory overtones of meat and spice that complement the wine's full body and creamy texture. The long finish echoes with hints of coffee, meat and plummy fruit. Drink now–2020.\n122005\tAustralia\tSingle Vineyard\t90\t25\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\t5OS Project 2012 Single Vineyard Shiraz-Viognier (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz-Viognier\t5OS Project\tGT_90_Points\tMade in an accessible, fruit-forward style, this medium-bodied wine features ample blackberry fruit and just hints of vanilla and cedar. Perhaps because of the Viognier component, it's already supple on the palate, yet the finish displays tart acids and some dusty astringency. Drink now–2020.\n43190\tAustralia\t\t90\t200\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCloudburst 2012 Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tCloudburst\tGT_90_Points\tThis medium-bodied Chardonnay is more restrained than the 2013, but still offers plenty of roasted-cashew toastiness combined with hints of pineapple and guava. The finish is clean and refreshing, but doesn't show the hoped-for length, so drink this over the near term.\n62372\tAustralia\tHarry & Edward's Garden\t90\t60\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTwo Hands 2006 Harry & Edward's Garden Shiraz (Langhorne Creek)\tShiraz\tTwo Hands\tGT_90_Points\tLike all of the 2006 Garden offerings from Two Hands, this one is full-bodied, creamy and makes a slightly sweet impression on the palate because of its combination of high alcohol (15.2%) and superripe fruit. Cedary, spicy oak accents raspberry and cassis flavors, which persist on the long finish. Drink now–2011.\n72981\tAustralia\tGnarly Dudes\t89\t35\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\t\t\tTwo Hands 2015 Gnarly Dudes Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tTwo Hands\tLT_90_Points\tBlackberry cordial leads in this fruit-driven wine, followed by vanilla, mocha, black olive and a bit of dusting polish. The palate is plush and brambly backed by a good grip of fine-grained tannins and a savory olive finish. This will cellar nicely. Drink now–2027.\n78460\tAustralia\tBuzz Cut\t89\t14\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tShoofly 2007 Buzz Cut White (Adelaide)\tWhite Blend\tShoofly\tLT_90_Points\tYou won't find much varietal character in this blend of Viognier, Riesling, Chardonnay, Verdelho and Semillon, but what you get is a medium-bodied white that should prove versatile at the table. Peach, pear and citrus aromas and flavors are carried by moderate weight and a slightly creamy texture.\n29571\tAustralia\tPromised Land - Unwooded\t82\t10\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tWakefield 2002 Promised Land - Unwooded Chardonnay (South Australia)\tChardonnay\tWakefield\tLT_90_Points\tOffers cracker and wheat aromas, and light white stone-fruit flavors that seem coated in confectioner's sugar, or talc. Perhaps it's the “unwooded” designation talking, but this wine seems a little light, and not much like Chardonnay.\n115265\tAustralia\t\t90\t22\tVictoria\tBendigo\t\t\t\tFairbank Sutton Grange 2015 Sangiovese (Bendigo)\tSangiovese\tFairbank Sutton Grange\tGT_90_Points\tMade from organically farmed vineyards, with native yeast and old barrels, this wine is a melting pot of bright cranberry and raspberry, smoke, toast, florals and sweet herbs. Medium bodied, with silky tannins, and plenty of terroir expression, it's well priced to boot. A win all around.\n55937\tAustralia\tArt Series\t91\t45\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeeuwin Estate 2007 Art Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tLeeuwin Estate\tGT_90_Points\tA textbook example of Margaret River Cabernet Sauvignon, the 2007 Art Series offers perfumed cassis fruit just tinged with mint and tobacco. There's ample body yet classic Cabernet restraint, so it's not jammy or overdone. The tannins are supple enough to make it enjoyable now, yet sufficient to see it through 2018, at least.\n122421\tAustralia\tAmon-Ra Unfiltered\t96\t110\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGlaetzer 2010 Amon-Ra Unfiltered Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tGlaetzer\tGT_90_Points\tDespite this wine's weight and richness, it retains a superb sense of balance and structure. Firm acids and tannins support the blueberry fruit, while savory notes of mocha and roasted meat provide added dimension. Give it a few years in the cellar and drink it from 2015–2025.\n77046\tAustralia\tThe Factor\t95\t125\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2007 The Factor Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tWith aromas and flavors that range widely from grilled meat, espresso and black olive to dried herbs, cracked pepper and blueberry, this is an enormously complex wine. It's full bodied but balanced by ample acidity, which imparts terrific length to the finish. Drink now–2017, possibly longer.\n58034\tAustralia\tJackaman's\t90\t69\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLangmeil 2014 Jackaman's Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tLangmeil\tGT_90_Points\tInterestingly, I preferred this winery's entry-level Cabernet (Blacksmith) to this one. The 2014 Jackaman is so supple and easy to drink that it lacks a bit of the Cabernet austerity that makes the variety so attractive with red meats. Vanilla, dill and cassis notes finish softly dusty. This is very smooth and polished in texture, maybe too much so for me.\n59933\tAustralia\tThe Parson's Nose\t89\t18\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChapel Hill 2008 The Parson's Nose Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tChapel Hill\tLT_90_Points\tFull-bodied and supple in texture, this plummy Shiraz offers plenty of enjoyment at a realistic price. Vanilla and brown sugar notes frame blueberries and spice, with just a hint of bitterness apparent on the finish. Drink now–2012.\n102707\tAustralia\tMentor\t90\t38\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPeter Lehmann 2008 Mentor Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tPeter Lehmann\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a full-bodied yet crisp and firmly tannic Cabernet that appears in need of further cellaring. A prominent eucalyptus character accents notes of cassis and espresso, while the finish is a bit tough and gritty at this stage. Try 2018–2025.\n40609\tAustralia\tThree Blocks\t90\t30\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFox Creek 2014 Three Blocks Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tFox Creek\tGT_90_Points\tThis seems a bit oaky on the nose, where scents of baking spices and cedar dominate, but those elements are balanced out on the palate, where blackberries, plums and black currants comes to the fore. This is a full-bodied, ripe-textured wine worth a look. Drink now–2025.\n49632\tAustralia\t\t81\t15\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPatritti 2007 Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tPatritti\tLT_90_Points\tStarts with some odd aromas of burnt rubber, charred plum and scorched marshmallow, then delivers slightly sweet, caramelly flavors. It's thick and viscous in texture yet without much in the way of tannin.\n125066\tAustralia\tHarry's Monster\t87\t30\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSexton 2004 Harry's Monster Red (Yarra Valley)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tSexton\tLT_90_Points\tThe Monster is approximately half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest a blend of Merlot (27%), Petit Verdot (12%) and Cabernet Franc (10%). Aromas and flavors are savory and slightly leathery, with a soft core of plum and cherry fruit, hints of cocoa and a long finish.\n17755\tAustralia\tThe Dry Dam\t92\t17\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale-Adelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2015 The Dry Dam Riesling (McLaren Vale-Adelaide Hills)\tRiesling\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tNeither McLaren Vale nor Adelaide Hills are particularly known for their Rieslings, but this is a fine example. Scents of wet stone and flower-shop greens lead into off-dry flavors of lemon zest and green apples. The balance between sugar and acids, lithe body and long finish is finely judged. Drink now–2025.\n12624\tAustralia\tThe Dry Dam\t88\t16\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\t\t\tD'Arenberg 2008 The Dry Dam Riesling (McLaren Vale)\tRiesling\tD'Arenberg\tLT_90_Points\tIntense and tightly wound, this Riesling gradually unfolds layers of white pepper, green plums and Key lime pie. The lingering quince-flavored finish is mouthwateringly crisp but not quite dry. Try with mushroom pasta. Drink now for the youthful fruit or wait a few years for more complexity.\n26143\tAustralia\tThe Seven Surveys Old Vines\t89\t15\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPeter Lehmann 2005 The Seven Surveys Old Vines G-S-M (Barossa)\tG-S-M\tPeter Lehmann\tLT_90_Points\tThe blend includes just 14% Mourvèdre, with the balance split evenly between Shiraz and Grenache, and the result is a medium-bodied red with soft tannins and plenty of ripe fruit. Blackberry, plum and spice notes show good concentration and some chocolaty overtones. Drink now and over the next several years.\n26183\tAustralia\tCliff Edge\t89\t18\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMount Langi Ghiran 2003 Cliff Edge Shiraz (Victoria)\tShiraz\tMount Langi Ghiran\tLT_90_Points\tThe 2003 Cliff Edge Shiraz shows plenty of intensity: bright cranberry-raspberry fruit, bold notes of cured meat and overtones of cedary oak. Tannins are supple, the structural underpinnings reliant on crisp acids instead. Use that tartness to offset some of the richness of stews or roasts.\n15553\tAustralia\tMiracle Hill\t94\t70\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKilikanoon 2010 Miracle Hill Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tKilikanoon\tGT_90_Points\tBig and bold, with firm tannins, this powerful Shiraz shows all the ingredients that point to excellent aging potential. Hints of toast and cracked pepper accent dark-berry aromas, while the flavors mix ripe fruit and intriguing spice notes. The finish is marked by espresso, firm tannins and terrific length. Drink 2020–2030.\n56439\tAustralia\tDry Red Wine No. 1\t92\t75\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYarra Yering 2004 Dry Red Wine No. 1 Red (Yarra Valley)\tCabernet Blend\tYarra Yering\tGT_90_Points\tFolks who enjoy herbal complexities in their Cabernet shouldn't pass this wine up. Aromas of roasted peppers, eucalyptus and cassis verge on vegetal, but the flavors are more refined, layering rich chocolaty notes over cassis and hints of green pepper. It's only medium-bodied, but still packs in plenty of intensity, evidenced on the long, silky finish. Drink now–2020.\n59455\tAustralia\tThe Experiment Estate Single Vineyard\t90\t36\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\t\t\tPenny's Hill 2015 The Experiment Estate Single Vineyard Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tPenny's Hill\tGT_90_Points\tA red cherry aroma is interwoven with violets and dried herbs. The supple palate of juicy fruit is balanced by silky tannins and a medium mouthfeel, followed by a herbal finish.\n45466\tAustralia\tDry Red Wine No. 2\t93\t90\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYarra Yering 2010 Dry Red Wine No. 2 Shiraz (Yarra Valley)\tShiraz\tYarra Yering\tGT_90_Points\tAfter 21 months in 50% new French oak and a few years in bottle, this Shiraz (it contains traces of Mataro, Viognier and Marsanne) is dominated on the nose by graham crackers and vanilla. The fruit surges forward on the palate, bringing plummy, meaty flavors to the fore. This is fuller bodied than most Yarra Valley Shirazes, with a plush mouthfeel and a long, warm, spicy finish.\n127606\tAustralia\tCeravolo\t83\t12\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSt. Andrews Estate 2000 Ceravolo Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tSt. Andrews Estate\tLT_90_Points\tNo oak means that the pear and melon flavors are front and center in this slightly syrupy wine that finishes unexpectedly hard and tart, with metallic notes.\n62847\tAustralia\t\t85\t16\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\t\t\tChalice Bridge 2001 Chardonnay (Western Australia)\tChardonnay\tChalice Bridge\tLT_90_Points\tLight in weight and subtle in flavor, this Chard is a welcome change from some of its mega-mallowy Oz compatriots. There are citrus and peach flavors on the palate and floral, yellow fruit aromas; it starts to get toasty with aeration.\n104772\tAustralia\tScrubby Rise\t87\t10\tSouth Australia\tFleurieu Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWirra Wirra 2000 Scrubby Rise Red (Fleurieu Peninsula)\tRed Blend\tWirra Wirra\tLT_90_Points\tThis easy-to-drink blend of 50% Shiraz, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot starts off jammy, with black cherry liqueur and clove notes before settling down and developing some interesting peach and mocha nuances. The persistent finish, lined with velvety tannins, makes it stand out from the crowd. Best Buy. —J.C.\n89365\tAustralia\t\t87\t17\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWakefield 2008 Shiraz (Clare Valley)\tShiraz\tWakefield\tLT_90_Points\tSupple at first, with brown sugar and prune flavors that seem sweetly ripe, but this full-bodied wine firms up substantially on the finish, where it turns a bit leathery in flavor and coffee-astringent. Drink now, before the fruit fades.\n25113\tAustralia\t\t86\t19\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2008 Shiraz-Viognier (Eden Valley)\tShiraz-Viognier\tYalumba\tLT_90_Points\tThis is the midlevel entry in Yalumba's Shiraz-Viognier range, slotting in above the Y Series but below the Hand Picked. It's a medium-bodied, slightly creamy-textured wine, with prominent green olive and peppercorn nuances to its plummy flavors. It fades a little on the finish, so drink now–2013.\n9985\tAustralia\t\t89\t26\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSidewood 2009 Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tSidewood\tLT_90_Points\tSidewood's 2009 Chardonnay is a throwback to the sort of delicious, well-priced Chardonnays Australia used to be known for, but with a touch more class. It delivers a big blast of upfront melon and peach fruit nestled in toasted cashew-like oak, then finishes fresh and citrusy. Good value for drinking over the next 6–12 months.\n49582\tAustralia\tReserve\t89\t23\tNew South Wales\tMudgee\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAndrew Harris 2000 Reserve Chardonnay (Mudgee)\tChardonnay\tAndrew Harris\tLT_90_Points\tThere's nothing subtle about this wine, which layers tropical fruit and pecan aromas over flavors of buttered nuts and citrus. Turns lemony on the finish. The intense flavors are all powered by an undercurrent of gravelly nuttiness.\n34155\tAustralia\tBlack Bubbles Sparkling\t84\t25\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\t\t\tShingleback NV Black Bubbles Sparkling Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tShingleback\tLT_90_Points\tA sleek name and a sleek wine. Vanilla and toffee overflow from the effusive nose while sour candy and plum jam take over on the palate. It's a tad thin in the mouth but finishes on a lovely raspberry note that has just a bit of sticking power. Drink as the Australians do, with Christmas dinner.\n17052\tAustralia\tWine Men of Gotham\t85\t11\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGotham 2013 Wine Men of Gotham Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tGotham\tLT_90_Points\tFor the price, this is pretty decent.

Tart acidity and some warmth on the finish provide a piquant counterpoint to the gobs of fruit. Drink now. Imported by Cellar Door.\n17791\tAustralia\tE Series\t85\t20\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tElderton 2013 E Series Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)\tShiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon\tElderton\tLT_90_Points\tThe Cabernet accounts for just 10% of the blend, but presumably contributes the hints of dried marjoram that add interest to the vanilla and cassis aromas and flavors.

Hints of espresso and black olive impart complexity to the plum and blueberry fruit, and a licorice note chimes in on the softly textured finish.\n74572\tAustralia\t\t88\t16\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPeter Lehmann 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tPeter Lehmann\tLT_90_Points\tLehmann's 2006 Barossa Cab is an easy-drinking, crowd-pleasing red that should find its way into many steakhouses as a by-the-glass pour. Minty notes accent cassis and tobacco flavors, while the wine's soft tannins will provide a welcome counterpoint to rich steaks.\n121512\tAustralia\tTyche's Mustard Single Vineyard\t90\t85\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2011 Tyche's Mustard Single Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tDespite some plum fruit, this single-vineyard Shiraz tracks more to the savory side, blending notes of espresso, earth, roasted meat and black olive. It's full bodied and slightly creamy and dusty in texture, with a long finish.\n1903\tAustralia\t\t89\t30\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tStrathewen Hills 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yarra Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tStrathewen Hills\tLT_90_Points\tA crisp medium-bodied Cab with good varietal definition, Strathewen Hill's 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon boasts slightly minty cassis-inflected fruit, vanilla and chocolate notes and a smooth mouthfeel. Supple tannins on the finish suggest this will age well through 2012 or so.\n43195\tAustralia\tTiers Vineyard\t93\t70\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTapaNappa 2006 Tiers Vineyard Chardonnay (South Australia)\tChardonnay\tTapaNappa\tGT_90_Points\tBrian Croser's efforts with Tiers Vineyard Chardonnay have finally paid off in a big way. This is a plump, amply textured wine that doesn't lack for elegance, marrying scents and flavors of toasted grain with white peaches and hazelnuts. Long and intense on the finish, echoing with toasty oak but also layers of vibrant fruit. Drink now–2015.\n118804\tAustralia\t\t89\t19\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCooralook 2004 Shiraz (Heathcote)\tShiraz\tCooralook\tLT_90_Points\tBlended with 15% from the Mornington Peninsula, this is a medium-bodied, supple Shiraz with enough crisp acidity for balance. The aromas are dark and loamy, but the palate surprises with red raspberries and darker, earthier, meatier undercurrents. Drink 2010–2018.\n49840\tAustralia\tThomas Hyland\t86\t14\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenfolds 2008 Thomas Hyland Riesling (Adelaide)\tRiesling\tPenfolds\tLT_90_Points\tSlightly musky and briny on the nose, with a broad underlay of peach. This medium-bodied Riesling seems lightly honeyed and a little soft relative to its peer group. A user-friendly introduction to Australian Riesling that should be consumed over the next 6–9 months.\n124452\tAustralia\t\t83\t27\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTamar Ridge 2004 Pinot Noir (Tasmania)\tPinot Noir\tTamar Ridge\tLT_90_Points\tThis already mature wine starts off with aromas of herbs and beet greens, then quickly turns leathery with exposure to air. Flavors of leather, dried fruit and decay are a bit lean and astringent. Although the fruit seems to be departing rather precipitously, there's sufficient complexity to merit interest.\n60899\tAustralia\tWilliam Randell\t89\t40\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tThorn Clarke 2008 William Randell Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tThorn Clarke\tLT_90_Points\tShows some of the warmth of the vintage in its elevated alcohol levels and high-toned fruit. It's full-bodied and supple, with flavors of brandied plums and baking spices. Drink it over the next few years.\n95863\tAustralia\t\t84\t7\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAlice White 2007 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)\tChardonnay\tAlice White\tLT_90_Points\tClean and fruity--what can one reasonably ask of a wine at this price point?

The ample weight and dusty texture is appealing, but purists may quibble with the amount of dill in this robust Cabernet. Drink now–2025.\n124260\tAustralia\tSparkling\t88\t24\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSchild Estate 2005 Sparkling Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tSchild Estate\tLT_90_Points\tA soft, easy-drinking sparkling Shiraz, much like Schild's still versions.

Still, it represents a reasonable value.\n129406\tAustralia\tCharleston\t85\t20\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tNepenthe 2005 Charleston Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills)\tPinot Noir\tNepenthe\tLT_90_Points\tThis medium-bodied Pinot features aromas of vanilla, beet greens and a touch of cola to go with extremely soft tannins. Flavors of cola, cedar and earth end on hints of tart berries and coffee.\n746\tAustralia\tClassic\t85\t9\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJacob's Creek 2015 Classic Pinot Grigio (South Eastern Australia)\tPinot Grigio\tJacob's Creek\tLT_90_Points\tMelon and citrus aromas and flavors mingle easily in this cleanly made quaffer. It's a bit plump on the palate, yet refreshing on the lemon-lime finish.\n58660\tAustralia\t\t89\t22\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tShaw and Smith 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)\tSauvignon Blanc\tShaw and Smith\tLT_90_Points\tIn line with the winery style, this is lean and tight on the palate, a bit of a citrus laser blending lime and grapefruit. Try it with raw seafood dishes, like a fluke carpaccio or ceviche.\n129230\tAustralia\tDiamond Label\t86\t10\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRosemount 2009 Diamond Label Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tRosemount\tLT_90_Points\tGen Yers and Baby Boomers will remember when Rosemount's ubiquitous Diamond Label wines represented great value. This Cab offers slightly confected cherry fruit, a whisper of mint and hints of vanilla. It's round in the mouth without being heavy, a fresh fruity wine for immediate gratification.\n113119\tAustralia\tPromised Land Unwooded\t88\t13\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWakefield 2015 Promised Land Unwooded Chardonnay (South Australia)\tChardonnay\tWakefield\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a plump, succulent Chardonnay for drinking by the end of 2016. The apple, citrus and pear notes are pretty simple, but clean, with a long, refreshing finish.\n113469\tAustralia\t\t89\t20\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTurkey Flat 2016 Rosé (Barossa Valley)\tRosé\tTurkey Flat\tLT_90_Points\tThis 95% Grenache rosé is a pale salmon hue. Subtle melon and berry fruit marks the nose, while the palate is medium in body and silky in texture, finishing with mouthwatering acids. Drink now.\n24195\tAustralia\t\t87\t17\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSticks 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yarra Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tSticks\tLT_90_Points\tNicely balanced, this is the sort of restrained Cab Sauvignon Yarra Valley can do well, with hints of mint and eucalyptus layered over cassis fruit. The texture is creamy, the tannins smooth. It's not as rich as the 2003, or a barrel sample of the 2006, but it's well crafted and harmonious.\n32263\tAustralia\tRobinson\t93\t55\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMoorooduc 2013 Robinson Chardonnay (Mornington Peninsula)\tChardonnay\tMoorooduc\tGT_90_Points\tDespite its moderate alcohol level, this comes across as medium to full in body, with a velvet and custard texture that coats the palate with flavors of grilled pineapple, citrus and melon. It's made in a concentrated, opulent style, yet it finishes clean, with lingering notes of citrus. Drink now through 2020.\n16538\tAustralia\tThe Family Tree\t95\t65\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLambert 2013 The Family Tree Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tLambert\tGT_90_Points\tRich, dense and intense, this is a big, muscular rendering of Barossa Shiraz. Scents of maple syrup and menthol intertwine with flavors of ripe plums and grilled meat. It's mouthcoating and long on the tannic finish, so give it some time in the cellar; drink 2020–2030.\n14331\tAustralia\t\t92\t40\tSouth Australia\tPadthaway\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenry's Drive Vignerons 2013 Shiraz (Padthaway)\tShiraz\tHenry's Drive Vignerons\tGT_90_Points\tFull bodied, creamy in texture and lush on the palate, this wine offers a thrilling mouthful of satisfaction.

By purist standards, it's too drinkable, too approachable now, with tannins that just glide into the background. Drink now–2020.\n34099\tAustralia\t\t93\t38\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChapel Hill 2012 Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tChapel Hill\tGT_90_Points\tThis winery uses ample amounts of oak, but in years when the fruit concentration matches that intensity the wines can be compelling. Cedar and vanilla notes frame blackberry and cassis fruit in this firmly structured wine that folds in savory notes of roasted beef and black olive on the finish. Drink 2020–2030.\n72017\tAustralia\tCatapult\t88\t20\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWirra Wirra 2014 Catapult Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tWirra Wirra\tLT_90_Points\tThis is ripe, fruit-driven Shiraz with ample weight and ripeness. Hints of smoke and sage add nuance to the blueberry and black cherry fruit, while coarse-grained tannins provide adequate structure and grip. Drink now–2022.\n33626\tAustralia\tDiana Madeline\t91\t95\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCullen 2009 Diana Madeline Red (Margaret River)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tCullen\tGT_90_Points\tThe 2009 Diana Madeline is 88% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance a blend of Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec. It boasts lovely aromas of cassis and tobacco leaf or dried herb, while on the palate it is restrained. For all of the aromatic boldness and purity, it's a bit austere, ending on a firm, crisp note. A 2002 tasted recently was just hitting its stride, so give it another 6–8 years.\n112398\tAustralia\tRed Bucket\t87\t15\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tLongview 2007 Red Bucket Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)\tShiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon\tLongview\tLT_90_Points\tThis blend of 66% Shiraz and 34% Cabernet Sauvignon has an appealing green pepper edge that provides a lift to the intense berry and toast notes that float on a soft carpet of tannins. Solid length and definition. Drink now or hold a few years for more complexity.\n21949\tAustralia\tBolero\t90\t16\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMarlargo 2006 Bolero Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tMarlargo\tGT_90_Points\tMarlargo appears to be a reasonably successful attempt at fashioning a pan-Australian brand, sourcing fruit from different parts of the country. This Clare Riesling starts with scents of talcum powder and lime sherbet, then follows those up with similar flavors. It's muscular and taut, even a bit austere, clocking in at only 11.4% alcohol. May develop through 2015.\n26692\tAustralia\tScotsdale\t91\t25\tWestern Australia\tGreat Southern\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHoward Park 2005 Scotsdale Shiraz (Great Southern)\tShiraz\tHoward Park\tGT_90_Points\tHoward Park's single-vineyard Cabernet and Shiraz bottlings offer consistently good value for the money. The 2005 Scotsdale Shiraz delivers layers of mixed berries, baking spices and hints of dried fruit and toasty oak. It's full-bodied, lush and creamy-textured in the mouth, with a long finish powered by fruit and shaped by dusty tannins. Drink now-2020.\n47126\tAustralia\t\t91\t70\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAlpha Crucis 2012 Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tAlpha Crucis\tGT_90_Points\tA fine effort, this is full bodied and creamy in texture. High alcohol buoys the mulberry fruit, while hints of cedar, mocha and smoke add nuance. It's slightly warm and peppery on the finish, a pleasing finale to a mouthfilling wine.\n114940\tAustralia\tDoctoressa di Lago Single Site\t90\t15\tSouth Australia\tFleurieu Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tZonte's Footstep 2010 Doctoressa di Lago Single Site Pinot Grigio (Fleurieu Peninsula)\tPinot Grigio\tZonte's Footstep\tGT_90_Points\tNicely rounded in texture without being flabby, this is a lively, crisp white wine, well endowed with flavors reminiscent of melon, pear and lime. Perfect to drink now with most seafood dishes, or as an apéritif.\n113027\tAustralia\t\t90\t20\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBrokenwood 2015 Semillon (Hunter Valley)\tSémillon\tBrokenwood\tGT_90_Points\tLike most young Hunter Valley Semillons, this is starting out on the neutral, acidic side. Notes of melon and citrus rind only hint at the potential to be found in a few years' time. It's a little weightier than expected, with a silky mouthfeel and a long, gentle, lime-riddled finish.\n107338\tAustralia\tThe Y Series\t88\t12\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2013 The Y Series Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tYalumba\tLT_90_Points\tThis isn't the biggest, baddest Cabernet. Instead, it's more of a charmer—lithe and crisp. Cherries and dried herbs on the nose add hints of earth and pepper on the palate, then finish with a gentle wash of dusty tannins. Drink now–2018.\n40612\tAustralia\tAshmead Single Vineyard\t89\t108\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tElderton 2010 Ashmead Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tElderton\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine ticks all the boxes, but just lacks the excitement and drama to take it to the next level. Smoke and vanilla notes add interest to the juicy, easy-to-drink cassis fruit. There's ample but not too much weight on the palate. Supple tannins. Perhaps it just needs additional cellaring time to warrant the price, although it doesn't come across as needing it in the structural sense.\n2958\tAustralia\t\t86\t37\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPearson Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tPearson Vineyards\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a perfectly fine example of Clare Valley Cabernet, one that emphasizes refinement and elegance over sheer power and intensity. Cassis, tobacco and a hint of vanilla account for the bulk of the aromatic and flavor interest, and it turns mouthwatering on the finish. Should hold well through 2015.\n124695\tAustralia\tThorny Devil Old Vine Single Vineyard\t92\t30\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tThistledown 2013 Thorny Devil Old Vine Single Vineyard Grenache (Barossa Valley)\tGrenache\tThistledown\tGT_90_Points\tThis international venture based out of the former Nepenthe winery in the Adelaide Hills sources fruit from a number of vineyards in South Australia. This bottling is light on its feet for its 15% stated abv, showcasing fresh cherry fruit, gentle herbal notes and silky tannins. Drink now–2022.\n49620\tAustralia\t\t82\t14\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTerra Australis 2007 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)\tShiraz\tTerra Australis\tLT_90_Points\tChocolate and prune aromas and flavors come across as somewhat generic, then finish on a drying, astringent note.\n116335\tAustralia\t\t87\t15\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLittle Rebel 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Yarra Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Merlot\tLittle Rebel\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a classically proportioned Bordeaux blend, featuring 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot. Mint and cassis aromas pick up shadings of dried herbs and tobacco on the palate, ending with good persistence and a certain degree of elegance. Because of that, serve this wine alongside a roast rather than a big, beefy steak.\n9929\tAustralia\tAngel Gully\t90\t50\tSouth Australia\tClarendon\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJoseph 2003 Angel Gully Shiraz (Clarendon)\tShiraz\tJoseph\tGT_90_Points\tFrom a top subsection of McLaren Vale, this well-crafted Shiraz features a nice balance of sweet and savory notes. Ripe blackberry and plum flavors are matched by nuances of cedar, spice and meat. This creamy-textured Shiraz seems to be already approaching maturity; drink it now through 2012.\n104424\tAustralia\tThe Moorooduc McIntyre\t91\t65\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMoorooduc 2014 The Moorooduc McIntyre Pinot Noir (Mornington Peninsula)\tPinot Noir\tMoorooduc\tGT_90_Points\tA different vintage from the odd-numbered ones surrounding it, 2014 yielded wines of less ripeness and intensity. Despite that, this is a fine effort, offering overtones of green peppercorns, dried spices and fresh herbs over tart pie-cherry and cranberry fruit. It's taut and focused, silky without being soft. Drink 2020–2030.\n69618\tAustralia\tThe Fruit Bat Single Vineyard\t91\t85\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2010 The Fruit Bat Single Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tFull bodied and supple, this is one of the more opulent and open of d'Arenberg's array of single-vineyard wines. Notes of vanilla, maple syrup and bramble berries mark the nose, while the flavors add cassis and tobacco elements. It's a pretty, fleshy wine for drinking now–2020, although it may age well even past that.\n102203\tAustralia\tMount Barker\t85\t21\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPlantagenet 1999 Mount Barker Chardonnay (Western Australia)\tChardonnay\tPlantagenet\tLT_90_Points\tLeads off with dusty, nutty, sugary aromas, like the bottom of the bag of honey-roasted peanuts, but there's also hints of buttered toast, ripe pears and black pepper. Flavors are simpler—caramel and pineapple—and it's heavy on the palate.\n41478\tAustralia\t\t87\t26\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPunters Corner 1998 Shiraz (Coonawarra)\tShiraz\tPunters Corner\tLT_90_Points\tThe tart, sour cherry fruit merely serves to support the leathery, earthy, spicy elements; the fruit never really takes charge. That said, the wine does have plenty to offer. The dried-spice aromas are an attractive blend of cracked black pepper, cinnamon and clove the mouthfeel is smooth and rich. Finishs long, with hints of espresso. —J.C.\n41489\tAustralia\t\t86\t28\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWirra Wirra 1999 Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tWirra Wirra\tLT_90_Points\tLoaded with earthy espresso and charred wood, this full-bodied Shiraz makes for a chunky mouthful of wine.

Drink it through 2017.\n54232\tAustralia\t\t86\t18\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tInnocent Bystander 2014 Pinot Gris (Victoria)\tPinot Gris\tInnocent Bystander\tLT_90_Points\tThe scents of toasted brioche and vanilla reflect the fact that half of the wine was barrel fermented. As a result, it's got some weight and texture to it, but the fruit, outside a dash of pineapple, is relatively muted.\n30526\tAustralia\tThe Y Series Sangiovese\t88\t12\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2013 The Y Series Sangiovese Rosé (South Australia)\tRosé\tYalumba\tLT_90_Points\tNo doubt the screw cap closure has contributed to this wine's longevity. Even more than 18 months after bottling, it still comes across as crisp and refreshing. Notes of tangerine, melon rind and strawberry offer plenty of appeal. Still, I wouldn't wait any longer.\n12869\tAustralia\t\t91\t30\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeconfield 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tLeconfield\tGT_90_Points\tThis mature, ready-to-drink example of Coonawarra Cab offers complex aromas and flavors of leather, cedar and black cherry, plus hints of mint and roasted beef. The tannins are smooth, the mouthfeel moderately rich and the finish long and mouthwatering. Drink now-2015.\n27685\tAustralia\tTic Tok\t85\t14\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJames Oatley 2010 Tic Tok Pinot Grigio (Adelaide Hills)\tPinot Grigio\tJames Oatley\tLT_90_Points\tAnother faintly copper-hued Pinot Grigio from the Oatley family, this one offers modest apple, melon and citrus notes, medium body and a slightly tannic edge to the tart, lemony finish.

The 2010 is full bodied, creamy-textured and plush, filled with dark fruit and hints of vanilla, asphalt, maple syrup and mocha. The supple tannins enhance rather than impede the finish, contributing scary length. Drink now–2030.\n40993\tAustralia\tBrand's Laira Vineyards\t85\t28\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMcWilliam's of Coonawarra 2002 Brand's Laira Vineyards Shiraz (Coonawarra)\tShiraz\tMcWilliam's of Coonawarra\tLT_90_Points\tThis medium- to full-bodied Shiraz starts off with aromas that suggest cured meats and slightly stewed plums, while the flavors are even meatier, picking up some citrusy notes. Crisp acids accentuate some drying tannins on the finish, giving this wine a somewhat stern demeanor. Imported by McWilliam's of Coonawarra.\n59433\tAustralia\tShadow's Run Unwooded\t85\t17\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFox Creek 2007 Shadow's Run Unwooded Chardonnay (McLaren Vale)\tChardonnay\tFox Creek\tLT_90_Points\tPeach, pear and melon notes on the nose and in the mouth are tinged with some slightly herbal (fennel?) notes, turning tart and citrusy on the finish. It's a pleasant, medium-bodied quaff for the summer months.\n50493\tAustralia\t\t88\t32\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tEppalock Ridge 2004 Cabernet Merlot (Heathcote)\tCabernet Merlot\tEppalock Ridge\tLT_90_Points\tThere's a hint of sur-maturité to this wine's cassis flavors, giving it a chocolate and dried-fruit character to go with hints of eucalyptus. That ripeness gives it a rich, soft, warm character that makes it instantly approachable. Drink now-2012 or so.\n113440\tAustralia\tWhalebone Vineyard\t89\t86\tSouth Australia\tWrattonbully\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTapaNappa 2006 Whalebone Vineyard Merlot (Wrattonbully)\tMerlot\tTapaNappa\tLT_90_Points\tThis firmly built Merlot shows almost Cabernet-like reserve in its tobacco, cherry and cassis shadings that finish woody, warm and firm. At the moment, the copious oak sits atop the fruit, suggesting at least another 2–3 of cellaring prior to full enjoyment.\n54697\tAustralia\tMad Russian\t86\t19\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide\t\t\t\tNova Vita 2008 Mad Russian Chardonnay (Adelaide)\tChardonnay\tNova Vita\tLT_90_Points\tThe Mad Russian manages to evince very ripe fig, orange and candied lemon peel fruit while maintaining a crisp, refreshing structure. Despite a shade of oiliness, the finish is quite appealing; we can only wish the lovely grapefruit and lemon candy flavors would hang around a bit longer. Drink now to one year.\n17927\tAustralia\t\t87\t20\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKoonowla 2009 Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tKoonowla\tLT_90_Points\tBright, crisp and fresh, as a 2009 Clare Riesling should be, this is a pretty wine, blooming on the nose with floral notes, apples and citrus fruit. The lime and green apple flavors are zesty on the finish, but not that long or intense. Probably best from now–2014, but could develop interesting nuances beyond that.\n17926\tAustralia\tThe Ratbag\t87\t20\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHugh Hamilton 2008 The Ratbag Merlot (McLaren Vale)\tMerlot\tHugh Hamilton\tLT_90_Points\tPretty good Merlot, with varietally correct scents of black cherries and mocha leading into flavors of blue and black fruits.

Notes of vanilla, maple syrup and bramble berries mark the nose, while the flavors add cassis and tobacco elements. It's a pretty, fleshy wine for drinking now–2020, although it may age well even past that.\n3886\tAustralia\tClassic\t86\t12\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\t\t\tMarquee 2008 Classic Chardonnay (Victoria)\tChardonnay\tMarquee\tLT_90_Points\tA solid value, the Marquee Victoria Chardonnay has an appealing restraint, hitting pretty high notes on the nose but turning serious and weighty in the mouth.

Drink now. 500 cases imported.\n83972\tAustralia\tCranes\t87\t36\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenschke 2000 Cranes Chardonnay (Eden Valley)\tChardonnay\tHenschke\tLT_90_Points\tThere's a distinct hardness to this wine, so that the fruit comes across more as a tough-skinned yellow-plum than as a soft, ripe peach. It's a little stingy on the midpalate, but there are plenty of other things to make up for it. Melon and pineapple flavors add layers of interest, as does the toasty, nutty finish.\n5290\tAustralia\t\t88\t13\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHope Estate 2009 Shiraz (Hunter Valley)\tShiraz\tHope Estate\tLT_90_Points\tThis medium-bodied Shriaz displays a soft, creamy, inviting mouthfeel and a piquant counterpoint in its flavors of tart cherries and mulling spices.

Try pairing it against char-grilled steak or lamb.\n35027\tAustralia\tFSW8B Botrytis - 375 ml\t92\t19\tSouth Australia\tWrattonbully\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2009 FSW8B Botrytis - 375 ml Viognier (Wrattonbully)\tViognier\tYalumba\tGT_90_Points\tYalumba's mastery of Viognier extends even to this botrytis-affected dessert style, which offers scents and flavors of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade. It's not overly complex, but wonderfully concentrated yet balanced, with a long, honeyed finish. Drink it over the next few years.\n37876\tAustralia\tBethany Creek Vineyard - Limited Reserve\t93\t30\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\t\t\tHeritage Road 1999 Bethany Creek Vineyard - Limited Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tHeritage Road\tGT_90_Points\tDense all the way, from the dark, almost black color, to the huge aromas of blackberry jam, smoke and cassis, to the enormously fruity flavors. The texture is massive. This dry, complex wine coats the palate with all sorts of sensations, and the lush, sweet, fruity flavor lasts a full 30 seconds on the finish.\n56831\tAustralia\tLadies Who Shoot Their Lunch Wild Ferment\t91\t35\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFowles Wine 2014 Ladies Who Shoot Their Lunch Wild Ferment Chardonnay (Victoria)\tChardonnay\tFowles Wine\tGT_90_Points\tOne of Fowles' best efforts, this wine shows ample vanilla and toast influences from oak, but those elements play a necessary role in supporting and defining the ripe peach and melon fruit. This is medium to full in body, with a soft, pillowy texture and a long finish.\n38118\tAustralia\tBin 51\t90\t40\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenfolds 2012 Bin 51 Riesling (Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tPenfolds\tGT_90_Points\tEvaluating young Eden Valley Rieslings isn't easy, as they often don't show their full potential for several years. The 2012 Bin 51 is tight and linear, crisply focused and a bit one-dimensional at this age. But the lime-driven fruit is potent and the finish beautifully clean and long. It should develop well over the next 7–8 years or more.\n124962\tAustralia\tFrux Frugis\t89\t60\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tUlithorne 2003 Frux Frugis Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tUlithorne\tLT_90_Points\tSeemingly fully mature, this wine features lots of savory, meaty notes to go along with dried fruit aromas, then adds brighter, tart berry flavors on the palate. Vanilla, tobacco and crisp acids seem to be taking control of the finish, so drink up before the fruit fades.\n50845\tAustralia\tFirestick\t85\t14\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\t\t\tPooles Rock Wines 2001 Firestick Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tPooles Rock Wines\tLT_90_Points\tThis Chard offers a fair dose of oak (and the creamy-toasty goodness that goes with it), yet has tropical yellow fruit to back up the wood. Soft in the mouth; finishes dry and oaky.\n77165\tAustralia\t\t90\t20\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRobert Oatley 2014 Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tRobert Oatley\tGT_90_Points\tDespite its moderate alcohol level, this wine offers plenty of weight and richness. Oak-derived elements of vanilla and toast frame exotic hints of mango, pineapple and citrus. With its ample weight and plush texture, this wine is a throwback of sorts, yet it manages to achieve that with great focus and citrusy length.\n45078\tAustralia\t\t87\t16\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMarlargo 2006 Pinot Grigio (Adelaide Hills)\tPinot Grigio\tMarlargo\tLT_90_Points\tFrom its slight tinge of copper this wine appears to have had some skin contact, and perhaps that can account for it's almost Pinot Noir-like aromas of strawberries and sous bois. Stone fruit and citrus flavors are round on the palate, then finish fresh and vibrant, underscored by crisp acidity. Drink now.\n48644\tAustralia\tThe Ball Buster\t90\t17\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTait Wines 2006 The Ball Buster Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tTait Wines\tGT_90_Points\tAs the name suggests, this is a big wine (15.7% alcohol), but in this year the wine handles it well, balancing that weight with bold flavors of blackberry, vanilla, chocolate and cinnamon. Finishes tart and juicy, with coffee and olive shadings.\n21943\tAustralia\t\t90\t66\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tButting Heads 2005 Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tButting Heads\tGT_90_Points\tThis is an expressive Barossa Shiraz, combining ripe raspberry fruit and a lush, creamy texture with herbal, savory notes and crisp acidity.

Avoids any cooked character, finishing long and fresh. Drink now–2015.\n129726\tAustralia\tCroft\t90\t55\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenschke 2015 Croft Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tHenschke\tGT_90_Points\tHints of buttered toast and roasted nuts mark the nose of this medium-bodied wine. It's plump on the palate, blending cinnamon, clove and cashew notes with melon, peach and pineapple fruit, then comes to a close in more oak spice and some leesy richness.\n61148\tAustralia\tThe Pennant\t91\t70\tWestern Australia\tGreat Southern\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRobert Oatley 2011 The Pennant Cabernet Sauvignon (Great Southern)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tRobert Oatley\tGT_90_Points\tOatley Wines, based in eastern Australia, sources a few bottlings from out west, like this flagship Cabernet. Cedar, tobacco and cassis mingle easily on the nose and palate, while the texture is supple, turning to silk on the long finish. Drink now–2028.\n866\tAustralia\tHandpicked Grenache\t90\t25\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBeresford 2014 Handpicked Grenache Rosé (McLaren Vale)\tRosé\tBeresford\tGT_90_Points\tThis is ripe, rich and even a touch tannic—almost more of a light red than a true rosé. This makes it ideally suited to serve alongside summer's various grilled meats. Raspberry and cola flavors finish spicy and round.\n34404\tAustralia\t\t91\t20\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2009 Viognier (Eden Valley)\tViognier\tYalumba\tGT_90_Points\tShows all the beautiful Viognier notes you could ask for: flowers, spice, apricot and melon, carried by a succulent mouthfeel that remains fresh and vibrant from start to lingeringly spicy finish.

It still has its hallmark blackberry, spice and cocoa shadings, they're just in better overall proportion and balanced by more of an earthy, savory streak. The tannins are ripe and silky, the fruit bright on the finish.\n104868\tAustralia\tThe Château 100 Year Old Vines\t93\t100\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChâteau Tanunda 2009 The Château 100 Year Old Vines Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tChâteau Tanunda\tGT_90_Points\tFull bodied and supple, this wine shows an interesting array of sensory notes for Barossa Shiraz, with notes ranging from espresso, tar, mint and green peppercorn to dark chocolate and blueberry. Finishes long and softly dusty, suggesting the ability to age through 2020, although it's very drinkable now.\n51080\tAustralia\tThe Lackey\t83\t15\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tKilikanoon 2007 The Lackey Chardonnay (South Australia)\tChardonnay\tKilikanoon\tLT_90_Points\tHere's a wine with a limited repertoire, but the one tune it's beating is a good one: pineapple on the nose, pineapple in the mouth and pineapple on the short finish. Intensity and length are in short supply but this is a fine, refreshing choice for unthinking summer sipping. Drink now.\n3459\tAustralia\tThe Dagger\t88\t21\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRiposte 2015 The Dagger Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills)\tPinot Noir\tRiposte\tLT_90_Points\tPretty aromas of cherry and plum blossoms give way to fully ripe, slightly confectionary fruit, backed by hints of mocha. This medium-bodied Pinot Noir is supple in texture and softly dusty on the finish, making it an easy one to drink over the next couple of years.\n91188\tAustralia\tSparkling Cuvée\t85\t17\tSouth Australia\tPadthaway\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJip Jip Rocks NV Sparkling Cuvée Sparkling (Padthaway)\tSparkling Blend\tJip Jip Rocks\tLT_90_Points\tA fruit-driven style of sparkling wine, with apple and citrus notes only slightly touched by yeastiness. It's a bit coarse in texture, but soft and cuddly on the finish, making it easy to back for another sip.\n118144\tAustralia\tRobinson Vineyard\t83\t55\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMoorooduc 2011 Robinson Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mornington Peninsula)\tPinot Noir\tMoorooduc\tLT_90_Points\tWhat a big difference a year can make on the Mornington Peninsula, which juts daringly out into the Southern Ocean near Melbourne. This is lightweight and tart, revealing hints of decaying leaves, fruit reminiscent of pie cherries and virtually no tannin.\n90536\tAustralia\tGigglepot\t92\t49\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMollydooker 2014 Gigglepot Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tMollydooker\tGT_90_Points\tCreamy and plush may not be traditional Cabernet descriptors, but they're what this wine delivers. Vanilla and graham cracker notes swaddle mixed currant fruit in this big but cuddly teddy bear of a wine. Drink now–2022.\n807\tAustralia\tFarrago\t90\t66\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKooyong 2013 Farrago Chardonnay (Mornington Peninsula)\tChardonnay\tKooyong\tGT_90_Points\tWithout any new oak or lees stirring, this wine's sole focus is on the fruit. Pineapple, melon and peach notes are pure and striking, supported by just hints of vanilla and cream. This medium-bodied Chardonnay finishes in a flurry of tangerine and lime.\n122074\tAustralia\tILR Reserve\t92\t48\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBrokenwood 2009 ILR Reserve Semillon (Hunter Valley)\tSémillon\tBrokenwood\tGT_90_Points\tFor a wine at seven years of age, this is remarkably undeveloped. Hints of celery leaf and apple accent tart citrus fruit, still mouthwateringly crisp. There's some richness on the palate, but hold through at least 2020 if you prefer mature notes of honey, marmalade and toast.\n87623\tAustralia\tWarner Vineyard\t94\t100\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGiaconda 2008 Warner Vineyard Shiraz (Victoria)\tShiraz\tGiaconda\tGT_90_Points\tWith only 10 cases imported to the U.S., one suspects that this terrific wine will largely be found in exclusive restaurants. If you can find a bottle at a reasonable markup, jump on it, for this is one of Victoria's finest Shirazes. Hickory smoke, espresso and herbal notes accent raspberry fruit, whose brightness gives the wine extra lift and dimension. It's creamy and lushly textured without ever seeming heavy, and boasts a long, silky finish that echoes with suggestions of cocoa powder and pulverized coffee beans. Drink now–2025.\n100467\tAustralia\tNine Vines\t82\t12\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tAngove's 2006 Nine Vines Shiraz-Viognier (South Australia)\tShiraz-Viognier\tAngove's\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine shows strong barnyard and sulfur notes overwhelming an otherwise appealing nose of herbes de Provence and grilled pork. The palate is juicy, with appealing cherry notes while the smooth finish winds up on an ashy note.\n86895\tAustralia\tZoes\t86\t15\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tNepenthe 2000 Zoes Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tNepenthe\tLT_90_Points\tA smooth, easy-to-drink wine made to the New World formula: Sweet caramel, vanilla and peach aromas and flavors, capped off by spicy oak on the finish.\n7800\tAustralia\tHeytesbury\t92\t70\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tVasse Felix 2013 Heytesbury Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tVasse Felix\tGT_90_Points\tThis bottling is consistently among the best Margaret River Chardonnays, and the 2013 doesn't disappoint. Subtle notes of grilled peach and pineapple slices are carried by ample weight and richness on the midpalate, then gain focus and fold in citrus flavors on the long finish.\n86423\tAustralia\tLady of the Lake Single Site\t85\t14\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tZonte's Footstep 2009 Lady of the Lake Single Site Viognier (Langhorne Creek)\tViognier\tZonte's Footstep\tLT_90_Points\tThis South Australia Viognier comes across as restrained on the nose, offering up little more than some vaguely smoky or flinty notes, then delivers melon, pear and spice notes via a full-bodied, slightly oily-textured palate. Turns crisp and citrusy on the finish.\n50182\tAustralia\tStolen Block\t84\t35\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tReilly's 2006 Stolen Block Shiraz (Clare Valley)\tShiraz\tReilly's\tLT_90_Points\tMarked on the nose by scents of berry, rhubarb and leather, this wine morphs on the palate to offer flavors of prune, chocolate and date. Although the tannins are supple, the wine's substantial alcohol (15.8%) shows through on the finish. Probably best consumed in its youth.\n61024\tAustralia\tEmeri Sparkling Pinot Grigio\t84\t10\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDe Bortoli NV Emeri Sparkling Pinot Grigio Sparkling (South Eastern Australia)\tSparkling Blend\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tComes across as a bit sweet and soft, with tropical fruit and a lush, creamy texture. Clean and well made, but lacks complexity and length.\n99340\tAustralia\tLes Amis\t95\t185\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2013 Les Amis Grenache (Barossa Valley)\tGrenache\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tThis rich, opulent wine carries its massive oak load easily, marrying vanilla and toasted coconut notes with ripe plum and black cherry flavors. It's full bodied and plush, with supple tannins supported by the wood. Give it a few years to knit together and drink it 2020–2030.\n59977\tAustralia\tThe Peake\t96\t150\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHickinbotham 2013 The Peake Cabernet-Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet-Shiraz\tHickinbotham\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a top example of the classic Australian blend. Cabernet (57%) provides cigar box aromas and elongates the finish, while Shiraz (43%) fills out the midpalate. The combination is full-bodied yet muscular, generous yet firmly structured. Essence of cassis is framed by hints of vanilla and cedar, while the long finish shows off chewy tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink 2023–2035, and posssibly beyond.\n75887\tAustralia\tTate\t88\t15\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFranklin Tate 2014 Tate Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tFranklin Tate\tLT_90_Points\tThis plump, succulent wine is a solid value.

It's a very ripe style for Pinot Noir, combining ample weight with plush tannins and superripe dark cherry-berry fruit. Drink now.\n47085\tAustralia\t\t85\t13\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2016 Vermentino (South Australia)\tVermentino\tYalumba\tLT_90_Points\tMade in a crisp linear style, this is picked at a modest level of ripeness. The result is a relatively low alcohol wine, but one that lacks generosity, instead offering one-dimensional notes of tart grapefruit that linger on the finish.\n49441\tAustralia\tBin 51\t91\t20\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenfolds 2010 Bin 51 Riesling (Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tPenfolds\tGT_90_Points\tFeatures an admirably lean, elegantly fine line of acids from start to finish, off of which hang notes of crushed stone, green apple and lime, with just the merest hints of riper fruit, like nectarine. Crisp and long, this should develop well over the next 5–10 years.\n123935\tAustralia\t1919\t93\t100\tSouth Australia\tWrattonbully\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCasella 2007 1919 Cabernet Sauvignon (Wrattonbully)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCasella\tGT_90_Points\tOne of the plusses to having a cash-flow brand like Yellow Tail in the portfolio is that it gives the owners the opportunity to properly age their high-end wines prior to release. At 10 years old, this has acquired a veneer of silkiness and elegance that enfolds the cassis and red-currant fruit. There's no shortage of smoky, vanilla and brown-sugar inflected oak either. Drink now–2025.\n125433\tAustralia\t\t89\t16\tWestern Australia\tFrankland River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRocky Gully 2007 Shiraz-Viognier (Frankland River)\tShiraz-Viognier\tRocky Gully\tLT_90_Points\tMarked by fragrant plum aromas, this silky-textured wine adds cherries, anise and vanilla to the mix on the palate.

It's modest in alcohol, but reasonably plump on the midpalate, delivering melon and apple-skin flavors before finishing crisp and refreshing. Drink now.\n82408\tAustralia\tReserve\t88\t35\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tByrne 2013 Reserve Shiraz (Clare Valley)\tShiraz\tByrne\tLT_90_Points\tThere's nothing wrong with this wine, which represents a solid first foray into the American market by this family-owned producer. Mint, vanilla and red berries mingle easily on the nose, while the palate offers medium to full body and a creamy texture. Drink now–2025.\n71924\tAustralia\tThe Hermit Crab\t89\t17\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2015 The Hermit Crab Viognier-Marsanne (McLaren Vale)\tViognier-Marsanne\tD'Arenberg\tLT_90_Points\tThis is medium to full in body and rounded in the mouth, with loads of yellow plum and ripe pineapple flavors. It's not the most complex wine, but offers a satisfying mouthful of fruit and solid length. Drink now.\n78603\tAustralia\tThe Commitment\t93\t33\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLambert 2013 The Commitment Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tLambert\tGT_90_Points\tScents of vanilla and baking spices frame bold raspberry fruit on the nose, while the flavors take a more savory turn, toward mocha and grilled meat. This is full bodied and maybe even a touch warm, but it works, ending long and plush. Drink now–2025.\n65504\tAustralia\tThe Visionary Limited Release\t91\t180\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWakefield 2009 The Visionary Limited Release Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tWakefield\tGT_90_Points\tThe tannins of this refined yet full-bodied Cabernet come across as sinfully silky in texture, giving the wine a sense of softness while still providing structure. Smoke, maple syrup and cassis notes gracefully intertwine on the nose and palate, then end on a long, cedar-laced finish. Drink now–2020.\n51019\tAustralia\tLucindale\t92\t\tSouth Australia\tLimestone Coast\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDi Giorgio Family Wines 2013 Lucindale Cabernet Sauvignon (Limestone Coast)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tDi Giorgio Family Wines\tGT_90_Points\tAfter spending 18 months in oak, this wine has emerged toasty and vanilla-laden. That said, there's some impressive fruit underneath, medium-bodied and crisp, with undertones of raspberries and red currants that linger on the concentrated finish. Drink 2020–2030.\n86243\tAustralia\tYattarna\t91\t66\tSouth Australia\tHenty\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenfolds 2004 Yattarna Chardonnay (Henty)\tChardonnay\tPenfolds\tGT_90_Points\tDespite being a 2004 vintage wine, this top-shelf Chardonnay from Penfolds is still embryonic in its development, shrouded in some smoky, tarry, coffee-like aromas that call for brisk decanting. Underneath, you'll find richly textured layers of ripe, honeyed fruit and grilled peaches, ending with lingering notes of citrus. Drink now–2015.\n54714\tAustralia\tCoralinga\t86\t\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\t\t\tHenschke 2008 Coralinga Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)\tSauvignon Blanc\tHenschke\tLT_90_Points\tFocused apple, pear, lime and grass notes are punctuated by some refreshing minerality here. The wine's elegant in the mouth, with some earthy tones. If only the lovely fruit flavors on the finish hung around just a bit longer. Try with fresh goat cheese, sooner rather than later.\n61665\tAustralia\tChemin\t87\t36\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPunt Road 2013 Chemin Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)\tPinot Noir\tPunt Road\tLT_90_Points\tHerbal and stemmy (100% whole-bunch fermented), this is a bit of an outlier in the world of Australian Pinot Noir. It's light to medium in weight, with gentle tannins and tart cherry fruit. Oak takes the form of mocha on the finish. My initial impression was “simple but appealing,” but upon reflection perhaps it just needs more time to show its stuff.\n92709\tAustralia\t1850 Old Vine\t91\t80\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCirillo 2004 1850 Old Vine Grenache (Barossa Valley)\tGrenache\tCirillo\tGT_90_Points\tDespite this wine's 16% alcohol, it does an excellent job carrying it. There's a superripe lift to the aromas of black cherry and a hint of sur-maturité in the notes of apricot preserves, but this is a big, lush, creamy-textured wine with a wonderfully rich mouthfeel and layers of fruit on the finish. Drink now–2012.\n62920\tAustralia\t\t87\t18\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\t\t\tTintara 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tTintara\tLT_90_Points\tMocha and coffee aromas preface a palate full of dark, earthy-briary character. Medium-bodied; closes with tangy, tealike tannins.\n17398\tAustralia\t\t84\t11\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tParinga 2013 Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tParinga\tLT_90_Points\tLeather and dark plum aromas carry with them a bit of barnyard, and while the flavors are pleasantly dark and earthy, the finish turns slightly metallic. It's a reasonably full-bodied wine, but one that probably should be consumed soon.\n70158\tAustralia\t\t89\t17\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHeartland 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Langhorne Creek)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tHeartland\tLT_90_Points\tThe plush texture and silky midpalate almost define Langhorne Creek, and the cedar, cassis and tobacco notes are classic Cabernet. So what's the rub? The finish falls off just a bit too quickly. It's still nice stuff for the price.\n13873\tAustralia\tEmeri\t85\t13\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\t\t\tDe Bortoli NV Emeri Moscato (South Eastern Australia)\tMoscato\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose offers up just a bit of intrigue, with gardenia, musk and white rose scents, but the focus of this wine is really its core of baked apricot flavors that turn just a bit jammy on the finish. Sweet, but not out of balance, good as a summer apéritif.\n83510\tAustralia\tReserve\t86\t13\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tJacob's Creek 2006 Reserve Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tJacob's Creek\tLT_90_Points\tWhite pepper and dill scents make up a promising beginning and lead to a velvety palate with plenty of roasted meat and black cherry fruit. A fine choice with barbecue. Drink now to 2010.\n111049\tAustralia\tThe Love Symbol Single Site Savignin Blanc\t87\t15\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tZonte's Footstep 2010 The Love Symbol Single Site Savignin Blanc Savagnin (Langhorne Creek)\tSavagnin\tZonte's Footstep\tLT_90_Points\tOnce thought to be Albariño, this grape variety is actually native to France's Jura. In this example from South Australia, it's a lean, crisp white, with hints of pencil shavings that accent its grapefruity flavors. It's pretty, harmonious and a good all-around white for drinking over the next 6–9 months.\n113438\tAustralia\t\t89\t16\tWestern Australia\tPemberton\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRobert Oatley 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Pemberton)\tSauvignon Blanc\tRobert Oatley\tLT_90_Points\tOatley has sourced the fruit for this wine from way out in Western Australia thousands of miles from his home base, but the results show why it was worth it. The aromas and flavors seamlessly marry fig, melon and pink grapefruit notes, while the wine is mouthfilling and lush without being overweight. Drink it over the next 6–12 months.\n123761\tAustralia\t\t94\t54\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCherubino 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCherubino\tGT_90_Points\tOf the three Cherubino 2010 Cabernets, I slightly preferred this one (the blended version), but just by a hair. The nose boasts seductive aromas of cedar, smoke, brown sugar and maple syrup, backed up on the palate by a convergence of chocolaty and meaty flavors that end in a softly dusty finale. Full bodied and supple, it's drinkable now, but should drink well through at least 2020.\n118137\tAustralia\tMiss Molly\t83\t28\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMollydooker NV Miss Molly Sparkling (McLaren Vale)\tSparkling Blend\tMollydooker\tLT_90_Points\tCall me traditional, but 100% American oak (roughly one-third new) doesn't quite harmonize with sparkling Shiraz, at least in this instance. It's given a sappy, resiny, almost hoppy character that lingers on the palate, marrying uneasily with the black cherry fruit.\n93450\tAustralia\tVineyard Select\t90\t20\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAngove 2008 Vineyard Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tAngove\tGT_90_Points\tThere's an attractive minty note to this wine that some may find too prominent, but the underlying cassis fruit is strong and the wine's structure is firm. The tannins are even a bit chewy at this stage, so either give it a year or two to mellow or pair it with some rare beef or lamb.\n101212\tAustralia\tJester\t86\t22\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMitolo 2007 Jester Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tMitolo\tLT_90_Points\tCrisp black cherry and mint aromas burst from the glass, then carry over onto the chunky, authoritative palate before finishing slightly dusty and astringent. This medium-bodied Cabernet features plenty of intensity, it just needs a little time to settle down into a more refined package.\n17775\tAustralia\tThe Virgilius\t92\t45\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2015 The Virgilius Viognier (Eden Valley)\tViognier\tYalumba\tGT_90_Points\tThis is Yalumba's flagship Viognier, barrel-fermented for an extra layer of richness. Fig, melon and apricot notes mark the nose and palate, and while it is fully ripe and weighty, it carries its alcohol well. Fruit intensity easily balances the oak, which remains almost invisible.\n31307\tAustralia\t\t90\t30\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKaesler 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tKaesler\tGT_90_Points\tThis amply endowed, creamy-textured Cab may not make old bones, but it offers a delicious mouthful of rich cassis fruit, accented by hints of mint, tobacco and dark chocolate. It's silky enough to drink now, with a long, slightly warm finish.\n35719\tAustralia\tLady's Lane Vineyard\t91\t61\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTournon by Michel Chapoutier 2012 Lady's Lane Vineyard Shiraz (Heathcote)\tShiraz\tTournon by Michel Chapoutier\tGT_90_Points\tThis starts off slowly, but red raspberry notes emerge after some vigorous swirling. It's full-bodied and supple, featuring some berry tea-like flavors, hints of cocoa and a fine, softly dusty finish. Drink it over the next 10 years.\n365\tAustralia\tSt. Andrews Single Vineyard Release\t95\t60\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWakefield 2013 St. Andrews Single Vineyard Release Shiraz (Clare Valley)\tShiraz\tWakefield\tGT_90_Points\tThe Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky—full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut—but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now–2025.\n83615\tAustralia\tSophie's Garden\t86\t60\tSouth Australia\tPadthaway\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTwo Hands 2006 Sophie's Garden Shiraz (Padthaway)\tShiraz\tTwo Hands\tLT_90_Points\tHigh-toned on the nose, coming close to a hint of mail polish, which detracts slightly from the flavors of stewed berries and dark chocolate. It's full-bodied and round, leaving an almost confected impression on the palate.\n94106\tAustralia\tStrawberry Chocolate Sparkling\t88\t21\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChocolate Box 2008 Strawberry Chocolate Sparkling Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tChocolate Box\tLT_90_Points\tSparkling Shiraz is an acquired taste, but this is a good introduction to the genre. Simply put, it's a big, oaky Shiraz with bubbles, bursting with vanilla, blackberry, chocolate and cedar aromas and flavors. Enjoy it over the next few years for its youthful exuberance.\n118156\tAustralia\tSingle Vineyard\t82\t25\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBeresford 2013 Single Vineyard Chardonnay (McLaren Vale)\tChardonnay\tBeresford\tLT_90_Points\tLet me confess upfront: creamed corn was one of my favorite side dishes when I was a child. That said, it's not something I like in my wine, and this medium-bodied Chardonnay shows an excess of those sweet corn and lactic aromas and flavors.\n54602\tAustralia\t\t84\t48\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYabby Lake Vineyard 2005 Pinot Noir (Mornington Peninsula)\tPinot Noir\tYabby Lake Vineyard\tLT_90_Points\tA good wine...but disappointing given the high quality of the winery's Chardonnay.

The cherry and vanilla notes offer enough leafy, mushroomy, earthy complexity to satisfy. Ready to drink now and over the next few years.\n11742\tAustralia\tKillerman's Run\t89\t20\tAustralia Other\tAustralia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKilikanoon 2008 Killerman's Run Shiraz-Grenache (Australia)\tShiraz-Grenache\tKilikanoon\tLT_90_Points\tA blend of two-thirds Shiraz, one-third Grenache, Kilikanoon's entry-level blend is a soft, easygoing combination of blackberries, cola, brown sugar and cinnamon.

The 2006 offers scents of powdered minerals and lime followed by flavors of apple and citrus. It's medium-bodied but muscular, with plenty of intensity that comes through on the long finish. Drink now–2016.\n96558\tAustralia\tTruffle Chocolate\t87\t17\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChocolate Box 2009 Truffle Chocolate Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tChocolate Box\tLT_90_Points\tA pronounced herbal note adds a weedy edge to this otherwise full-bodied, plush Cabernet. Cassis fruit is potent without being overbearing, while the oak is prominent, lending structure and vanilla. Drink now.\n28127\tAustralia\tTwelve Staves\t90\t17\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLongwood 2006 Twelve Staves Shiraz-Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz-Grenache\tLongwood\tGT_90_Points\tThis 60-40 blend provides excellent value at this price. It's full-bodied but silky-soft in texture, with aromas and flavors that range from plum to earth and cola to dried spices. The tannins melt away on the palate, leaving behind a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now.\n83105\tAustralia\tThe Y Series\t89\t13\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2016 The Y Series Sauvignon Blanc (South Australia)\tSauvignon Blanc\tYalumba\tLT_90_Points\tYalumba generally offers fair value up and down its lineup, and this is a good example at the low end. Wet stone and lime aromas mark the nose, while the palate is pleasantly plump without being overly weighty. Pear and melon notes avoid the vegetal side of Sauvignon Blanc entirely. Drink now.\n46622\tAustralia\t\t84\t12\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Plains\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRed Earth 2004 Merlot (Adelaide Plains)\tMerlot\tRed Earth\tLT_90_Points\tOffers a mishmash of aromas that include plenty of woody notes like vanilla and toast as well as cherry fruit. The result in the mouth comes across as slightly medicinal, with cherry and menthol flavors that turn tangy on the finish. Imported by Walca International.\n83499\tAustralia\t\t86\t16\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\t\t\tCape Mentelle 2007 Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River)\tSauvignon Blanc-Semillon\tCape Mentelle\tLT_90_Points\tClassic Semillon aromas of hay and quince create an intriguing but subtle opening act while the simpler palate displays some attractive cut-grass notes from the Sauvignon Blanc. A good partner for flavorful shellfish preparations.\n24566\tAustralia\tPremium Rosé\t91\t27\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJansz NV Premium Rosé Sparkling (Tasmania)\tSparkling Blend\tJansz\tGT_90_Points\tThere aren't many better values in rosé sparklers than this. Hints of toast and citrus add nuance to strawberry scents on the nose, while brioche notes add depth to the palate. It's a bit creamy in texture, yet remains dry and refreshing on the finish.\n19071\tAustralia\tIsolation Ridge Vineyard\t91\t40\tWestern Australia\tFrankland River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFrankland Estate 2011 Isolation Ridge Vineyard Chardonnay (Frankland River)\tChardonnay\tFrankland Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a full-bodied, lushly textured Chardonnay that manages to avoid the sensation of excess weight. Pear, melon and white peach notes are framed by understated toasted nuttiness, while a long line of acid prolongs the harmonious finish. Drink now–2018.\n96998\tAustralia\tArtisan Wines Classic\t87\t13\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\t\t\tMarquee 2007 Artisan Wines Classic Riesling (Western Australia)\tRiesling\tMarquee\tLT_90_Points\tOpening with a mineral-lime edge, this wine announces that it's tough as nails when it's actually more of a teddy bear in the mouth. The off-dry palate is drenched in creamy peach, pear and apricot notes that linger on the finish.\n33677\tAustralia\tThree Blocks\t90\t30\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFox Creek 2014 Three Blocks Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tFox Creek\tGT_90_Points\tThis seems a bit oaky on the nose, where scents of baking spices and cedar dominate, but those elements are balanced out on the palate, where blackberries, plums and black currants comes to the fore. This is a full-bodied, ripe-textured wine worth a look. Drink now–2025.\n21553\tAustralia\t\t87\t18\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\t42°S 2008 Pinot Noir (Tasmania)\tPinot Noir\t42°S\tLT_90_Points\tLight, fresh and silky—just what might be expected from cool-climate Pinot Noir. A pleasant earthiness underscores prettily interwoven strands of herbs and cherries. It's exciting to see the burgeoning quality of the wines coming out of Tasmania.\n124964\tAustralia\tOrganic\t88\t15\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTemple Bruer 2005 Organic Shiraz-Malbec (Langhorne Creek)\tShiraz-Malbec\tTemple Bruer\tLT_90_Points\tThis unusual blend is 68% Shiraz and 32% Malbec, resulting in a full-bodied, deeply plummy wine. Hints of clove, pepper and earth impart welcome complexity on the nose, while the flavors fold in a black olive component. Softly tannic, so drink now or hold 2-3 years.\n81768\tAustralia\tRoennfeldt Road Goose-yard Block\t90\t100\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSchubert 2006 Roennfeldt Road Goose-yard Block Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tSchubert\tGT_90_Points\tMade in a very ripe style, this wine's traces of raisiny character detract slightly from its velvety, suede-like texture and ample concentration. It's still admirable for its concentration and richness, but some will find it overripe. Drink now-2015.\n104227\tAustralia\tMade With Organic Grapes\t90\t17\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2015 Made With Organic Grapes Chardonnay (South Australia)\tChardonnay\tYalumba\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a medium-bodied, richly textured Chardonnay that deserves a place on any table. Grilled pineapple and peach notes convey ripeness without excessive oak or weight, finishing long and plush. Drink now–2020.\n127225\tAustralia\tAbercrombie\t94\t90\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHoward Park 2012 Abercrombie Cabernet Sauvignon (Western Australia)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tHoward Park\tGT_90_Points\tA blend of Mount Barker and Margaret River fruit, this is lavishly oaked, chocolaty and rich, as decadent a bottle of Cabernet you'll find in Australia. Baking spices accent mocha and cassis in this full-bodied wine, which features a velvety texture and long finish. Drink 2020–2030, and possibly beyond.\n86912\tAustralia\t\t88\t10\tNew South Wales\tNew South Wales\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tReynolds 2001 Chardonnay (New South Wales)\tChardonnay\tReynolds\tLT_90_Points\tThese grapes are sourced from the relatively cooler region of Orange, and it shows in the wine's pear and citrus flavors. Hints of nuts (cashews, perhaps?) add complexity and style not often found in this price range. Crisp and clean on the finish, with refreshing citrus notes.\n85276\tAustralia\tOrphan Bank\t93\t57\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLangmeil 2010 Orphan Bank Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tLangmeil\tGT_90_Points\tThese 100-plus-year-old vines were transplanted to another site, but continue to yield outstanding wines. Intriguing aromas of fruit compote and roasted meat lead into a palate of blueberry and spice. It's medium to full in body, with supple tannins that finish on a faintly dusty note. Ready to drink now, but should hold at least through 2020.\n28138\tAustralia\tThe Ironstone Pressings\t90\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2005 The Ironstone Pressings G-S-M (McLaren Vale)\tG-S-M\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tThis blend of 70% Grenache, 25% Shiraz and 5% Mourvèdre features surprisingly dark fruit flavors akin to blackberries and cola. A hint of mint or eucalyptus enlivens the bouquet and helps to lighten this otherwise rather full-bodied, brooding wine. Finishes long, with enough dusty tannins to warrant cellaring through 2015.\n8932\tAustralia\tD Block Reserve\t91\t50\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tShingleback 2005 D Block Reserve Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tShingleback\tGT_90_Points\tDark and rich, with aromas of cola and coffee and flavors of plum and cola. This is full-bodied, its 14.5% alcohol balanced by fruit intensity and richly textured tannins and the long finish. Drink 2010–2020.\n19559\tAustralia\t\t90\t25\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTyrrell's 2016 Semillon (Hunter Valley)\tSémillon\tTyrrell's\tGT_90_Points\tClassic Hunter Valley Sem, if maybe just a little fruit-forward. Like tasting light-bodied lime juice that finishes fresh and clean. Drink it now with oysters, or put some aside for up to 10 years for it to develop toast, honey and marmalade aged characters.\n66989\tAustralia\t\t85\t16\tSouth Australia\tCurrency Creek-McLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBallast Stone Estate Wines 2004 Grenache (Currency Creek-McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tBallast Stone Estate Wines\tLT_90_Points\tShows decent complexity, with smoke, leather and spice notes dominating over modest levels of cranberryish fruit. Either this is beginning to dry out, or it was never all that lush to begin with. Drink up.\n88840\tAustralia\t\t84\t9\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDeakin Estate 2008 Moscato (Victoria)\tMoscato\tDeakin Estate\tLT_90_Points\tGrassy and slightly pungent, showing the distinct aromas of underripe Muscat, but the delicate texture—it's lightly sparkling—and sweet flavors win out on the palate, balanced by a fresh, citrusy finish.\n21782\tAustralia\tCircle Collection\t81\t10\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJindalee 2007 Circle Collection Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)\tShiraz\tJindalee\tLT_90_Points\tJindalee's 2007 is a medium-bodied Shiraz with slightly candied fruit and a sensation of sweetness on the short, soft finish.\n19378\tAustralia\tQuintet\t89\t125\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMount Mary 2010 Quintet Red (Yarra Valley)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tMount Mary\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a nice Bordeaux-style blend with pretty cherry and currant fruit and some cedar shadings, but lack the complexity of others in its style.

There's oak here—mostly present on the nutty, toasty nose—but there's not much of it rounding out the palate, which makes it feel a little disjointed. Still, a very good wine.\n96699\tAustralia\tWhite Chocolate\t85\t16\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChocolate Box 2008 White Chocolate Sauvignon Blanc (Eden Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tChocolate Box\tLT_90_Points\tRestrained aromatically, with a slight minerally-graphite note, this is a pleasantly stony wine, perhaps a bit austere.

It's crisp, racy and medium in body, perfectly suited to summertime refreshment. Drink now.\n85937\tAustralia\tKillerman's Run Grenache-Shiraz-Mataro\t88\t20\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\t\t\tKilikanoon 2015 Killerman's Run Grenache-Shiraz-Mataro Red (Clare Valley)\tRed Blend\tKilikanoon\tLT_90_Points\tThe French oak is prominent in this classic blend, but it's more or less balanced by ripe red fruit, sweet spice and hints of chocolate and smoke. The palate is medium to full bodied, red fruited, and finishes with charred, smokey flavors that last long. Drink now–2022.\n13519\tAustralia\tPolish Hill River\t85\t\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPauletts 2010 Polish Hill River Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tPauletts\tLT_90_Points\tHas typical Clare Valley Riesling elements of crushed stone and citrus, but also considerable petrol and hints of honey and ripe apple. It's medium-bodied and tart, with a metallic or slightly pithy note on the finish.\n110735\tAustralia\t\t89\t17\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHeartland 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Langhorne Creek)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tHeartland\tLT_90_Points\tThe plush texture and silky midpalate almost define Langhorne Creek, and the cedar, cassis and tobacco notes are classic Cabernet. So what's the rub? The finish falls off just a bit too quickly. It's still nice stuff for the price.\n98959\tAustralia\tVineyard Select\t85\t19\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAngove's 2007 Vineyard Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tAngove's\tLT_90_Points\tSpicy and herbal upfront, with cassis fruit that seems just a little dried out, giving way to molasses and brown sugar. It's a medium-bodied Cabernet with slightly drying tannins and a coarse-textured finish.\n109385\tAustralia\t\t89\t20\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYering Station 2010 Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)\tPinot Noir\tYering Station\tLT_90_Points\tThis is very close in quality to the winery's reserve bottling, boasting fully ripe cherry-berry fruit made complex by hints of vanilla and button mushroom. It's supple, silky and lingering on the finish, marked by lingering notes of vanilla and berry. Drink now.\n59753\tAustralia\tCornella Vineyard\t87\t45\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJasper Hill 2007 Cornella Vineyard Grenache (Heathcote)\tGrenache\tJasper Hill\tLT_90_Points\tMinty and raisiny on the nose, with Port-like elements of dried fruit and high (15.0%) alcohol. Still, it shows the variety's trademark delicate structure and silky texture.\n4928\tAustralia\t\t86\t28\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJosef Chromy 2009 Pinot Noir (Tasmania)\tPinot Noir\tJosef Chromy\tLT_90_Points\tLight and fresh in style, with pleasant cherry fruit accented by delicate notes of green herbs and sous bois. It's a pretty wine, quaffable even, with hints of charred oak and coffee showing up on the finish. Drink now.\n116890\tAustralia\tDry Red Wine No. 2\t91\t95\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYarra Yering 2009 Dry Red Wine No. 2 Shiraz-Viognier (Yarra Valley)\tShiraz-Viognier\tYarra Yering\tGT_90_Points\tVintage after vintage, this wine impresses for its complexity and balance, and the 2009 won't disappoint on those counts. It may not be the biggest, baddest Dry Red No. 2, but it features blueberry fruit and espresso and black olive shadings, a lovely supple texture and a softly lingering finish. Drink it over the next few years.\n127120\tAustralia\tPeace Family Vineyard\t83\t10\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\t\t\tAndrew Peace 2007 Peace Family Vineyard Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)\tChardonnay\tAndrew Peace\tLT_90_Points\tClassic Chardonnay aromas of apple, pear and hay lead into a palate marked by decent intensity but also a bit of sweetness. Orange and candy notes run through the rather short finish.\n31602\tAustralia\t\t90\t16\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tEarthworks 2013 Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tEarthworks\tGT_90_Points\tThe 2013 entry-level Shirazes from Barossa provide a great opportunity for wine consumers to rediscover Australia. This one is solidly structured and savory, boasting hints of black olive, dark chocolate and espresso. The finish is completely dry and firm, suggesting it'd be a fine accompaniment to beef or lamb. Drink now–2025.\n49168\tAustralia\tWarburn\t86\t10\tNew South Wales\tNew South Wales\t\t\t\tRiverina Estates 2001 Warburn Chardonnay (New South Wales)\tChardonnay\tRiverina Estates\tLT_90_Points\tGoes down so easy; if you can't get away to Cancun for vacation, this is the next best thing. This is a tropical Chardonnay if ever there was one, with pineapple and melon notes on the palate, and with pineapple and coconut on the nose. Finishes dry, with some citrus peel.\n11891\tAustralia\tArt Series\t90\t22\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeeuwin Estate 2015 Art Series Riesling (Margaret River)\tRiesling\tLeeuwin Estate\tGT_90_Points\tTasted blind, this wasn't particularly different from the other Rieslings in its flight, which were predominantly South Australian. It's got those same wet stone and citrus tendencies and is made in the same medium-bodied, dry, high-acid style. There's a touch of pineapple as well, plus a long, dry crisp finish.\n71518\tAustralia\tMojo\t86\t20\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRockBare 2008 Mojo Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)\tSauvignon Blanc\tRockBare\tLT_90_Points\tA solid, well-made Sauvignon Blanc from RockBare that combines aromas of melon rind and underripe nectarine with flavors of stone fruit and citrus, this is a nice wine, albeit not one that solves the mystery of what Austin Powers was missing in The Spy Who Shagged Me.\n109434\tAustralia\tThe Swinging Malaysian Single Vineyard\t96\t85\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2010 The Swinging Malaysian Single Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tD'Arenberg's lineup of single-vineyard Shirazes is especially impressive in the 2010 vintage, and this was one of my favorites. The aromas are tight, nearly impenetrable at first, then only stubbornly yielding hints of graphite, but the mouthfeel is expansive and richly textured. Aristocratic notes of pencil shavings balance supple tannins and layers of dark fruit, concluding in espresso and chocolate on the finish. Drink now–2030.\n117168\tAustralia\tTilly's Vineyard\t85\t\tSouth Australia\tBarossa-Adelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenschke 2008 Tilly's Vineyard White (Barossa-Adelaide Hills)\tWhite Blend\tHenschke\tLT_90_Points\tThis is mainly Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc, with 25% Chardonnay and 9% Pinot Gris to round out the midpalate. Apple and citrus flavors dominate, and there is a certain plumpness to the wine but it retains its essentially citrusy character throughout.\n32344\tAustralia\tIllicium\t89\t\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHeartland 2014 Illicium Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Langhorne Creek)\tShiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon\tHeartland\tLT_90_Points\tThis is the first vintage for this wine, a 50-50 blend of Cabernet and Shiraz matured in French and American oak hogsheads for a year. Vanilla notes frame mixed-berry flavors, then pick up savory hints of beef and espresso on the softly dusty finish. Drink now through 2020.\n41492\tAustralia\t\t86\t30\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tVirgin Hills 1998 Red (Victoria)\tRed Blend\tVirgin Hills\tLT_90_Points\tAttractive aromatics and plenty of complexity are the pluses; the minus is a healthy dose of bell pepper. Smoke, herbs, eucalyptus and sour cherry hang on a claret-style frame. —J.C.\n1666\tAustralia\t\t85\t9\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHalf Mile Creek 2014 Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (South Eastern Australia)\tSemillon-Sauvignon Blanc\tHalf Mile Creek\tLT_90_Points\tWet stone and graphite scents up front give way to hints of honey and Earl Grey tea (bergamot). It's medium bodied and fades quickly on the finish, but it's a solid buy for under $10.\n62941\tAustralia\t\t87\t12\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\t\t\tRosemount 2003 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)\tShiraz\tRosemount\tLT_90_Points\tA very good year for the Diamond Label Shiraz. It's a chunky, sturdy red with mixed plums and a ribbon of mocha or chocolate from the nose through to the finish. Not overdone, and very enjoyable.\n35522\tAustralia\tLouis\t87\t42\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenschke 2015 Louis Semillon (Eden Valley)\tSémillon\tHenschke\tLT_90_Points\tThis lacks the underripe edge of Hunter Valley Semillon or the ripeness and breadth of Barossa Valley versions, so I guess you could say it expresses its Eden Valley terroir. That said, it's a bit neutral, with modest fig and citrus flavors that finish long and crisp.\n16863\tAustralia\tOrganic\t85\t13\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGreen Path 2006 Organic Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)\tShiraz\tGreen Path\tLT_90_Points\tSold in 1-liter Tetra Prisma packaging meant to reduce greenhouse emissions, this is an ecofriendly wine that tastes good. Its bouquet is its strongest asset, offering floral, perfumy notes of white pepper and rhubarb, while the palate is on the light side for Shiraz, but clean and supple. Drink now.\n54406\tAustralia\tJulius\t88\t40\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenschke 2014 Julius Riesling (Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tHenschke\tLT_90_Points\tThis medium-bodied dry Riesling is pleasingly aromatic, boasting scents of ginger, pear and citrus. Then it's linear and focused on the palate, delivering wet stone and crisp citrus flavors that finish long. Drink now–2025.\n120335\tAustralia\t\t89\t29\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFrogmore Creek 2007 Pinot Noir (Tasmania)\tPinot Noir\tFrogmore Creek\tLT_90_Points\tThis rather chunky example of Tasmanian Pinot Noir isn't typical of the genre, but impresses for its bold black-cherry fruit. Some menthol-like notes give it a slightly medicinal quality, but the persistent finish and fine tannins more than compensate. Drink this idiosyncratic effort over the next 4–5 years.\n124582\tAustralia\tBilli Billi\t83\t15\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\t\t\tMount Langi Ghiran 2008 Billi Billi Pinot Grigio (South Eastern Australia)\tPinot Grigio\tMount Langi Ghiran\tLT_90_Points\tNeutral in the extreme, this is an easy pick for a large crowd. It's light on its feet and quite crisp with an over-arching theme of nuts and just a faint hint of citrus. Drink up.\n16872\tAustralia\tSensitive Cousin\t85\t15\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tStanley Lambert 2005 Sensitive Cousin Pinot Noir (South Eastern Australia)\tPinot Noir\tStanley Lambert\tLT_90_Points\tA soft, silky-textured Pinot Noir, this wine starts off with admirable complexity on the nose in the form of bacon, smoke, fresh greens and strawberries. Despite an overall lack of punch, it's easy to drink and offers decent value in Pinot Noir. Imported by AUSA Pacific, LLC.\n95085\tAustralia\t\t90\t28\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tElderton 2006 Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tElderton\tGT_90_Points\tElderton is making classically styled Barossa Shiraz, marrying raspberry fruit with rich chocolaty overtones and wrapping them in a soft cocoon of supple tannins and balanced acidity.

It's full bodied, creamy and supple, amply concentrated but still very approachable. Drink now–2023.\n24498\tAustralia\tHills & Valleys\t90\t15\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPikes 2014 Hills & Valleys Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tPikes\tGT_90_Points\tDespite its modest alcohol level, this bottling speaks of ripe fruit. Lime and bergamot aromas bring a floral element, while the flavors are of tangerine and nectarine. A touch of residual sugar adds roundness to the mouthfeel.\n29225\tAustralia\tPrelude Vineyards\t92\t36\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeeuwin Estate 2012 Prelude Vineyards Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tLeeuwin Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThis is remarkably lush and full-bodied, yet remains lively and mouthwatering. Toasted nuts frame ample flavors of grilled pineapple and melon. Drink now–2017. The success of this wine should be a good indicator that, when released, the 2012 Art Series will be something spectacular.\n11633\tAustralia\t\t85\t23\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSchwarz Wine Company 2015 Rosé (Barossa Valley)\tRosé\tSchwarz Wine Company\tLT_90_Points\tOnce past a distracting note of tire rubber, this rosé of Grenache offers aromas of wet stone and watermelon rind. Berry fruit emerges on the palate, while the dry finish picks up hints of chocolate. Drink now, but maybe give it a quick splash into a decanter to see if that improves it.\n60518\tAustralia\tSparkling\t89\t18\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tParinga 2015 Sparkling Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tParinga\tLT_90_Points\tThis young, fruit-driven sparkling red delivers the party in a bottle.

Mint, cassis and chocolate round out the palate, finishing softly tannic. Drink now–2010.\n39553\tAustralia\tThe Footbolt\t87\t19\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2008 The Footbolt Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tD'Arenberg\tLT_90_Points\tFull bodied, lush and slightly liquorous in style, the 2008 Footbolt is also packed with peppery, slightly herbal blackberry fruit. There's also a hint of menthol. Drink it over the next 12 months.\n65482\tAustralia\t\t90\t17\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWakefield 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tWakefield\tGT_90_Points\tTaylors (exported under the Wakefield Estate label) is a top-notch source for Cabernet Sauvignon. The 2004 boasts a big nose of cassis, mint or eucalyptus and a touch of roasted peppers. It's mouthfilling, with plenty of soft tannins, then finishes with more cassis and a hint of coffee.\n99103\tAustralia\tBin 389\t89\t19\tAustralia Other\tAustralia\t\t\t\tPenfolds 1998 Bin 389 Cabernet Sauvignon (Australia)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tPenfolds\tLT_90_Points\tMade for almost 40 years—since 1962—this edition of 389 sports lots of spicy American oak, and displays black fruit and tobacco aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is big, the texture rich and the full, spicy finish is long and tannic. It's drinkable now, but really needs a few years to unwrap a bit, and the oak mantle will probably always be heavy. Satisfying, though somewhat one-dimensional.\n73738\tAustralia\t\t88\t16\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\t\t\tSt Hallett 2008 Riesling (Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tSt Hallett\tLT_90_Points\tExceptionally intense, this is a wine for real aficionados of Australian Riesling. Stone and gravel tango with aromas of lime juice and coconut, all of which is underscored by a firm minerality. Long, dry finish. Delicious. Try with pork in a mustard sauce.\n34642\tAustralia\tKevin John\t94\t109\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCullen 2012 Kevin John Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tCullen\tGT_90_Points\tAlthough Cullen's latest red wines haven't always impressed, the quality of the Chardonnay seems to go from great to even greater. This is plump enough to be appealing now, yet with a strong frame of acidity to hold it together for the next 10 or more years. Toasted nuts and fresh pineapple aromas and flavors are exotic upfront, while the lemony finish is long and mouthwatering.\n34895\tAustralia\tIndividual Vineyard Selection Dry\t87\t15\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPewsey Vale 2008 Individual Vineyard Selection Dry Riesling (Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tPewsey Vale\tLT_90_Points\tHints of honey, citrus and petrol mark the aromas of this wine from a legendary Eden Valley estate. It's a medium-bodied rendition of Riesling, dry and petrolly, with a long, concentrated finish that suggests that this wine could safely be cellared for up to 10 years.\n81317\tAustralia\tMappinga\t91\t25\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSidewood 2015 Mappinga Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tSidewood\tGT_90_Points\tThis silky-textured, medium-bodied wine starts off with aromas of toasted marshmallow and ripe citrus. The flavors show more range, covering hints of melon, white peach, lime, pineapple and roasted cashew, before finishing long and crisp.\n78144\tAustralia\tArt Series\t94\t89\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeeuwin Estate 2012 Art Series Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tLeeuwin Estate\tGT_90_Points\tLeeuwin's Chardonnay continues to be a standard-bearer for Margaret River and all of Australia. The 2012 Art Series is subtly toasty on the nose, blossoming with time into full-on crème brûlée aromas, while the palate offers creamy-textured notions of tropical fruit and custard. The long finish reverberates with fruit, suggesting plenty of aging potential, up to 10 or 12 years.\n58894\tAustralia\tEmily's Paddock Shiraz-Cabernet Franc\t93\t125\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJasper Hill 2014 Emily's Paddock Shiraz-Cabernet Franc Red (Heathcote)\tRed Blend\tJasper Hill\tGT_90_Points\tTo be fair, the Cabernet Franc portion of this wine is only 3%, so don't expect to be bowled over by Loire-like florals or leafiness. Rather, it's a dense full-bodied wine, savory in style, with edgings of charred meat, grilled plum, mocha and a long cocoa-tinged finish. Drink 2020–2030.\n58715\tAustralia\tThe High Trellis\t86\t20\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2013 The High Trellis Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tD'Arenberg\tLT_90_Points\tCrisp and tightly wound, this is a relatively austere Cabernet with an astringent finish. Cassis emerges with enough airing, accompanied by tart cranberries, which act to accentuate the drying tannins. Try after 2020.\n22862\tAustralia\t\t93\t40\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tVasse Felix 2013 Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tVasse Felix\tGT_90_Points\tWinemaker Virginia Willcock's latest effort shows that top-flight Margaret River Chardonnay doesn't have to cost three figures. This is fine stuff, a bit funky at first, but opening up in the glass to reveal hints of brown-sugar-glazed pineapple and fresh citrus. It's medium to full in body, with a long, almost painfully crisp finish that brings all that fruit into bright, refreshing focus.\n41776\tAustralia\t\t91\t16\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSt Hallett 2014 Riesling (Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tSt Hallett\tGT_90_Points\tThis is appropriately austere for a young Eden Valley Riesling, offering crisp green apple and lime sensations backed by subtle grace notes of wet stone. The finish is long, mouthwatering and almost painfully tart, suggesting it will fare well in the cellar for up to 10 years.\n23060\tAustralia\t\t91\t59\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tShirvington 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tShirvington\tGT_90_Points\tThis full-bodied, creamy-textured Cabernet is ready to drink. Confected notes of cassis and vanilla are slightly exaggerated, but make a big impression on the palate, while the supple tannins linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now–2020.\n71764\tAustralia\tOld School Red\t90\t23\tVictoria\tCentral Victoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tOne Million Cuttings 2015 Old School Red Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Central Victoria)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz\tOne Million Cuttings\tGT_90_Points\tA relatively new brand from Tahbilk, the Old School Red blends 55% Cabernet Sauvignon with 45% Shiraz. The result is a medium- to full-bodied red with a silky texture and flavors reminiscent of cassis, vanilla and baking spices. Drink it over the next several years.\n72223\tAustralia\tEmily's Paddock Shiraz-Cabernet Franc\t91\t125\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJasper Hill 2005 Emily's Paddock Shiraz-Cabernet Franc Shiraz (Heathcote)\tShiraz\tJasper Hill\tGT_90_Points\tAlthough there is only 5% Cab Franc in the blend, it appears to have quite an impact on this wine's aromas, which are intriguingly perfumed and contain some minty, leafy notes. Flavors also hint at mint with some subtle cedary notes, although the primary fruit is blueberry. Like the 2005 Georgia's Paddock, it's full-bodied and creamy-textured, although this wine adds a slightly more tannic edge to the finish. Drink 2010–2020.\n35597\tAustralia\tReserve\t91\t40\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLongwood 2005 Reserve Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tLongwood\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a full-bodied, firmly structured Shiraz with plummy, intense aromas tinged with licorice and framboise. Bits of chocolate, mint and spice accent the plum and raspberry flavors, and the wine finishes crisp, dry and deeply textured. It should drink well from now through 2015.\n56058\tAustralia\tSt. Andrews\t88\t50\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWakefield 2006 St. Andrews Shiraz (Clare Valley)\tShiraz\tWakefield\tLT_90_Points\tThis full-bodied Shiraz is bulky and a bit loosely knit. The overtly smoky notes persist on the palate, vying with maple syrup and dark fruit flavors. It's a big, flavorful wine that needs time to come together, so consume over the next few years.\n30904\tAustralia\t\t91\t36\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBrokenwood 2010 Shiraz (Hunter Valley)\tShiraz\tBrokenwood\tGT_90_Points\tAmple vanilla notes from oak aging mark the nose and palate of this savory Shiraz. It's on the full side for the Hunter, with a rich texture and a long, velvety finish.

It's mouthfilling and generous, while a bit of tartness on the finish serves to highlight the coffee and earth flavors. Drink now-2017.\n128278\tAustralia\tShotfire\t92\t23\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tThorn Clarke 2013 Shotfire Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tThorn Clarke\tGT_90_Points\tSavvy shoppers may be able to find this for about $20, making it an excellent deal in a full-bodied, structured red wine.

Dried herbs and brown sugar add nuance, while the velvety finish picks up some meaty, savory notes. Drink now–2025.\n38056\tAustralia\tThe Lodge Hill\t90\t15\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\t\t\tJim Barry 2002 The Lodge Hill Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tJim Barry\tGT_90_Points\tThough it's crisp and fresh in the mouth, this wine has some weight (and some oily viscosity) to it. Starts off in the mouth with a burst of sweetness, and a limey, grassy streak carries it through to the finish. Nose is fruity, with nectarine and mango highlights.\n77167\tAustralia\tHills & Valleys\t90\t15\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPikes 2014 Hills & Valleys Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tPikes\tGT_90_Points\tDespite its modest alcohol level, this bottling speaks of ripe fruit.

Varietal notes of tobacco and mint add complexity, accented by touches of vanilla and chocolate. It's all presented on a framework of creamy, supple tannins. Drink now.\n28126\tAustralia\tAeolia\t90\t100\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGiaconda 2005 Aeolia Roussanne (Victoria)\tRoussanne\tGiaconda\tGT_90_Points\tA full-bodied, mouthfilling wine, Giaconda's 2005 Aeolia Roussanne showcases aromas of toasted cashews, then balances them against bold peach and citrus fruit. The oak lends a slightly charred quality to the wine, which comes through on the finish as a hint of espresso. Drink now and over the next few years.\n68065\tAustralia\t\t91\t36\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMoorooduc 2012 Pinot Noir (Mornington Peninsula)\tPinot Noir\tMoorooduc\tGT_90_Points\tMoorooduc's estate Pinot Noir is a solid value among the boutique offerings from the Mornington Peninsula. There's a supple cushioning of flesh wrapped around a firm backbone of acid, while the flavors run from black cherry and mint through earthier notes of brown sugar and roasted parsnip. Drink now through 2020.\n12254\tAustralia\tBin 707\t93\t90\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tPenfolds 1998 Bin 707 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tPenfolds\tGT_90_Points\tThe rich blackberry, vanilla and toast nose sets you up for a lush, supple wine and this one does not disappoint. Full and dense, it offers rich black-cherry and cassis flavors on the palate, and a huge finish with fine-grained tannins. Very well poised for its size, it's approachable now. Nevertheless, it will be much more nuanced and show more finesse in 5–8 years. Keep for a decade or two, maybe more. To be released 5/01.\n73105\tAustralia\tSparkling\t86\t20\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHardys NV Sparkling Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tHardys\tLT_90_Points\tSmells and tastes heavily oaked, with vanilla, smoke and toast layered over notes of blackberry and chocolate. Still, the texture is nice and the wood—if you like that sort of thing—is tasty. Finishes with a slightly drying edge.  Imported by Pacific Wine Partners.\n75355\tAustralia\tGnarly Dudes\t91\t35\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTwo Hands 2007 Gnarly Dudes Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tTwo Hands\tGT_90_Points\tTwo Hands' 2007 Gnarly Dudes is a nicely balanced wine, managing to be full bodied and supple in tannins while still coming in under 15% alcohol. Brown sugar and cinnamon shadings accent the main plum and earth elements, all wrapped up in a long, spicy finish. Drink now-2017.\n40752\tAustralia\tAustralian Old Vine Collection\t90\t100\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGibson's BarossaVale 2005 Australian Old Vine Collection Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tGibson's BarossaVale\tGT_90_Points\tA tiny bottling (220 cases) of old-vine Grenache, this wine features lovely aromas of cinnamon, clove and ripe cherries. In the mouth it's surprisingly elegant, delivering cherry and spice flavors without excessive weight, ending on a slightly tart note. Drink now and over the next 4–5 years.\n103335\tAustralia\tLieu Dit Malakoff\t82\t30\tVictoria\tPyrenees\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDomaine Terlato & Chapoutier 2009 Lieu Dit Malakoff Viognier (Pyrenees)\tViognier\tDomaine Terlato & Chapoutier\tLT_90_Points\tThe wine looks a touch amber-like at the rim, with aromas of butterscotch and cracked pepper. The flavors carry a bruised-fruit character, and the wine seems a bit flabby on the palate. Not up to this project's usual high standards.\n60310\tAustralia\t\t86\t35\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYeringberg 2014 Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)\tChardonnay\tYeringberg\tLT_90_Points\tScents of singed orange peel, roasted nuts and lemon curd are promising, but are followed up by rather crisp, ungenerous lemon flavors. There's a silky textural element on the palate and a long finish, so it may yet come around.\n41488\tAustralia\tGraeme's Blend\t86\t25\tVictoria\tBendigo\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPassing Clouds 1998 Graeme's Blend Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Bendigo)\tShiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon\tPassing Clouds\tLT_90_Points\tThis big, rugged 60-40 blend may dry out if cellared too long, so drink it young with rare beef to help tame the substantial tannins. Smoke, dried-herb and black-currant flavors should mesh nicely with your next roast. —J.C.\n82031\tAustralia\tOld Vine\t88\t32\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYangarra Estate Vineyard 2013 Old Vine Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tYangarra Estate Vineyard\tLT_90_Points\tMatured in used French barriques, this nevertheless shows touches of toast and cedar alongside tart, fruit notes of cranberry and raspberry. It's full bodied and richly tannic, with crisp acids that accentuate the tannins on the finish. Drink 2020–2030.\n69650\tAustralia\tSexton Vineyard\t89\t42\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGiant Steps 2013 Sexton Vineyard Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)\tChardonnay\tGiant Steps\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of baking spices and pears lead the way, followed by flavors of pear and pineapple.

A hint of nail polish is a bit distracting, but the toasted coconut aromas and candied pineapple flavors offer plenty to like. Drink now.\n121675\tAustralia\tUnwooded\t87\t17\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCooralook 2005 Unwooded Chardonnay (Mornington Peninsula)\tChardonnay\tCooralook\tLT_90_Points\tThis medium-bodied Chardonnay starts off with some slightly nutty-almondy scents that might be mistaken for oak, but on the palate the fruit speaks loud and clear. Pear and lemon flavors ring out the loudest, followed by a refreshingly citrusy finish.\n67887\tAustralia\tThe Noble\t88\t19\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2006 The Noble Riesling (McLaren Vale)\tRiesling\tD'Arenberg\tLT_90_Points\tDespite an overlay of dried apricots and caramel, what is striking about this stickie is its intense essence of lime. The flavors of candied lime and pineapple are bright and fresh, finishing long and balanced, without an excess of sugar.\n83077\tAustralia\t\t88\t21\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\t\t\tMount Horrocks 2002 Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tMount Horrocks\tLT_90_Points\tZippy and fresh in the mouth, well balanced, with eye-opening fresh green herb and lemon peel flavors. The same green herb, plus some petrol, shows on the nose. A gravelly, minerally finish brings it to a dry close.\n122939\tAustralia\tThe Factor\t98\t125\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2013 The Factor Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tFull-bodied and plush yet vibrant and imbued with fresh fruit, this is simply superb. The oak is present but never dominant, adding brown sugar and cinnamon elements to blueberry, roasted meat, espresso and black olive notes. A hint of peppery spice also creeps into this impossibly complex wine. The finish combines power, length, freshness and dusty tannins, suggesting that while impressive now, it should age well. Drink now–2030.\n43613\tAustralia\tThe Broken Fishplate\t84\t17\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2015 The Broken Fishplate Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)\tSauvignon Blanc\tD'Arenberg\tLT_90_Points\tThis will likely prove a bit too vegetal for some, as the aromas hint at asparagus. But there's pineapple and honey on the palate and decent weight in the mouth.\n28185\tAustralia\tTribal Elder\t92\t70\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tStrathewen Hills 2004 Tribal Elder Shiraz (Yarra Valley)\tShiraz\tStrathewen Hills\tGT_90_Points\tSmoky and meaty, this is aggressively savory in style, but really evolves with air to show a gentler, raspberry-fruited side accented by dried spices. It's medium- to full- bodied, with a slightly creamy texture and silky, mouthwatering finish. Terrific cool-climate Shiraz.\n28086\tAustralia\t\t88\t25\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTamar Ridge 2006 Pinot Gris (Tasmania)\tPinot Gris\tTamar Ridge\tLT_90_Points\tFrom Tasmania, this is a fine example of that island's aromatic whites. Crisp acidity imparts a tense, mineral-like quality to the melon and fennel aromas, and while there's enough flesh in the mouth to satisfy, there's also mouthwatering focus and purity. Drink now–2010.\n41589\tAustralia\tLucindale\t86\t16\tSouth Australia\tLimestone Coast\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDi Giorgio Family Wines 2013 Lucindale Chardonnay (Limestone Coast)\tChardonnay\tDi Giorgio Family Wines\tLT_90_Points\tThis medium-bodied wine balances pineapple fruit with bright acids and mid-range alcohol.

The tart cherry notes are angular, the tannins a bit chunky, but tea leaf and spice notes provide ample complexity. Try in 2013.\n98098\tAustralia\tRomas\t93\t75\tSouth Australia\tClarendon\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tClarendon Hills 2008 Romas Grenache (Clarendon)\tGrenache\tClarendon Hills\tGT_90_Points\tFull-bodied and lush in style, with aromas of cherries and spice. On the palate, it delivers waves of fresh fruit and hints of cocoa, but also enough complexity to hold your interest before finishing on a long, mouthwatering note. Drink now–2016.\n52097\tAustralia\t\t89\t\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWarramate 2012 Shiraz (Yarra Valley)\tShiraz\tWarramate\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose of this wine is intriguingly complex, hinting at violets, campfire, eucalyptus and cherry, yet on the palate, the wine doesn't fully live up to that promise. It's crisp and medium bodied, with flavors that actually become simpler and more fruit-driven with airing. Drink now–2020.\n115133\tAustralia\tMoppa\t92\t34\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKalleske 2014 Moppa Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tKalleske\tGT_90_Points\tAlthough labeled Shiraz, this wine also includes 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Viognier. Those additions help account for its impressive color and rich mouthfeel. Vanilla and cedar frame mixed berries, yet the wine remains savory and complex, adding hints of black olive, mocha and grilled meat. Drink this dense, full-bodied wine now through 2025.\n80784\tAustralia\tVintage Cuvée\t87\t44\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\t\t\tJansz 2011 Vintage Cuvée Sparkling (Tasmania)\tSparkling Blend\tJansz\tLT_90_Points\tFor one of Jansz's top sparklers, this particular vintage is a little off the mark. Starting on the vegetal side, with notes of wet grass, pear and bruised apple, the palate is rich but mealy, finishing on the same bruised apple and vegetal characters as the nose.\n106599\tAustralia\tUnoaked\t83\t11\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBush Bike 2005 Unoaked Chardonnay (Western Australia)\tChardonnay\tBush Bike\tLT_90_Points\tSmells and tastes slightly sour, with simple flavors of pineapple and citrus that finish with a tart edge.\n32987\tAustralia\t1927 Vines\t90\t33\tVictoria\tNagambie Lakes\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTahbilk 2006 1927 Vines Marsanne (Nagambie Lakes)\tMarsanne\tTahbilk\tGT_90_Points\tFrom vines that were 79 years old when the fruit was harvested, this is made in a deliberately lean style to encourage cellaring. Notes of lemon, crushed stone and apple skin are taut and dry, with a dusty, tactile sensation on the finish. Drink now, or hold through at least 2020 to allow for more development.\n35743\tAustralia\tGraveyard Vineyard\t91\t125\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBrokenwood 2013 Graveyard Vineyard Shiraz (Hunter Valley)\tShiraz\tBrokenwood\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine was inadvertently tasted against a bunch of Barossa giants, so I may have underestimated it. It still held its own, delivering subtle notes of plum, cinnamon and clove, plus hints of olive and mocha. It's medium in body, with some herbal notes, yet finishes dusty and mouthwatering. Drink now–2028.\n81379\tAustralia\tOld Winery\t82\t15\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTyrrell's 2000 Old Winery Pinot Noir (South Eastern Australia)\tPinot Noir\tTyrrell's\tLT_90_Points\tA sturdy wine, sporting plenty of roasted cherries and caramel on a medium-weight frame.

It's still broad and mouthfilling, but the plum and cassis flavors stay this side of overripe, buttressed by plenty of smoke, vanilla and spice. Long and savory on the finish. Drink now–2015. Imported by 34th Parallel, LLC.\n12045\tAustralia\tPlexus\t90\t40\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJohn Duval Wines 2011 Plexus G-S-M (Barossa Valley)\tG-S-M\tJohn Duval Wines\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine's plum, mocha and cedar notes are carried by ample body and a silky texture. It's a round, supple blend of 59% Shiraz, 31% Grenache and 10% Mourvèdre that finishes long, reverberating with fresh acids and mocha shadings. Drink it over the next several years.\n83148\tAustralia\tFaith\t91\t16\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSt Hallett 2013 Faith Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tSt Hallett\tGT_90_Points\tA terrific example of drink-now pleasure from the Barossa, this Shiraz deftly combines cedar and vanilla notes with dark fruit flavors. It's richly textured, with velvety tannins and crisp acids that frame the long finish. Drink now–2020.\n39387\tAustralia\tLieu-Dit Malakoff\t91\t40\tVictoria\tPyrenees\t\t\t\tDomaine Terlato & Chapoutier 2013 Lieu-Dit Malakoff Shiraz (Pyrenees)\tShiraz\tDomaine Terlato & Chapoutier\tGT_90_Points\tSlightly lighter on its feet than its sibling, L-Block, the Lieu-Dit shows more meat and black olive characters combined with ripe cherry, chocolate, cola, and oak spice. The palate is tangy and herbal while the powerful tannins are fine grained and the acidity well balanced. This should age rather nicely. Drink 2019–2037.\n13941\tAustralia\tVirgilius\t89\t40\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2009 Virgilius Viognier (Eden Valley)\tViognier\tYalumba\tLT_90_Points\tYalumba's flagship Viognier is a broad, powerful wine, with pineapple and apricot flavors marked by hints of floral perfume and spice. Not quite as aromatically expressive as the Eden Valley bottling, it may be a touch denser and more concentrated, with potential to evolve through 2014 or so.\n118131\tAustralia\tThe Little Villager\t84\t18\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tStable Hill 2013 The Little Villager Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills)\tPinot Noir\tStable Hill\tLT_90_Points\tCranberries and pie cherries give a crisp, almost citrusy, edge to this wine. The tannins are silky and there's some appealing clove-like spice as well, but the acids are elevated, making the wine come across as tart and ungenerous.\n94832\tAustralia\t\t89\t19\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWest Cape Howe 2005 Shiraz (Western Australia)\tShiraz\tWest Cape Howe\tLT_90_Points\tSurprisingly firmly built, with crisp acids and firm tannins framing plummy, blackberry fruit and vanilla, cinnamon and clove notes.

Think ripe cherry, dark chocolate and black olive notes. The palate is medium in weight and has a bitter, oaky finish. Drink 2018–2022.\n38075\tAustralia\tJulius\t89\t25\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\t\t\tHenschke 2001 Julius Riesling (Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tHenschke\tLT_90_Points\tFor a Riesling, the Julius is no lightweight. It's medium-weight, with pretty flavors of yellow fruit, resin, honeysuckle, even olive oil. Petrol and minerally notes play on the nose. A very good wine, and one with enough range of flavor to keep you guessing.\n103323\tAustralia\tWine Lovers\t82\t15\tNew South Wales\tOrange\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTamburlaine 2008 Wine Lovers Malbec (Orange)\tMalbec\tTamburlaine\tLT_90_Points\tLight to medium in body and rather tart, with leather and dried cherry notes that are submerged under an excessively medicinal character.\n1182\tAustralia\tBeacon Hill\t88\t13\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBeresford 2014 Beacon Hill Sauvignon Blanc (South Australia)\tSauvignon Blanc\tBeresford\tLT_90_Points\tBeyond a hint of stuck flint on the nose, this offers clean, varietally correct aromas and flavors of white nectarine, grapefruit and gooseberry. It's nicely balanced in the middle of the spectrum, offering a harmonious mix of stone fruit and citrus.\n96024\tAustralia\tReserve\t88\t23\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\t\t\tPikes 2001 Reserve Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tPikes\tLT_90_Points\tThis Reserve somehow didn't show quite as well as  Pikes's regular bottling, though it's still a very good wine. It's a little viscous in the mouth, with straw, lemon rind and mineral flavors that flow through the finish.\n125132\tAustralia\t\t86\t20\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tInnocent Bystander 2010 Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)\tPinot Noir\tInnocent Bystander\tLT_90_Points\tA lightweight but charming Pinot Noir, with pretty cherry fruit accented by notes of dried bracken and ground cinnamon.

Medium to full in body, the wine is pleasantly round in the mouth, then turns tart on the finish. Drink now-2015.\n87186\tAustralia\tThe Long Paddock\t83\t10\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRedbank 2007 The Long Paddock Shiraz (Victoria)\tShiraz\tRedbank\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a simple, cherry-dominated fruity quaff at a realistic price. It's only light to medium in body, with crisp acids and a bit of tannic astringency on the finish.\n117366\tAustralia\tBeginning\t87\t25\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\t\t\tThe Lane 2015 Beginning Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tThe Lane\tLT_90_Points\tRich and toasty in style, this has notes of ripe tropical fruits, figs, toffee and green herbs.

There's plenty of berry fruit here and a nice plum tone to the palate that carries over to the fleeting finish. A good choice for a big crowd.\n32929\tAustralia\tOld Vine\t88\t21\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFire Block 2004 Old Vine Grenache (Clare Valley)\tGrenache\tFire Block\tLT_90_Points\tThis style of simply yummy, quaffable wine is what Australian Grenache is so capable of producing. Despite high alcohol (16.5%), it doesn't show heat on the palate, instead offering oodles of black cherries and some accents of baking spices. It's round, supple and easy to drink, with a touch of coffee on the finish. Imported by USA Wine West.\n92172\tAustralia\t\t87\t18\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\t\t\tYering Station 2006 Shiraz-Viognier (Yarra Valley)\tShiraz-Viognier\tYering Station\tLT_90_Points\tThough a bit timid on the nose, this example is impressive for its intense tangle of flavors in the mouth, which run from watermelon candy, to raspberry, wet earth, leather and chocolate. A good structure of firm acidity and brawny tannins as well as the moderately long finish suggest this wine will improve with a few years in the cellar. It can also be consumed now alongside hearty fare.\n20968\tAustralia\t\t85\t\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\t\t\tBlackbilly 2015 G-S-M (McLaren Vale)\tG-S-M\tBlackbilly\tLT_90_Points\tInitial aromas are volatile yet attractive in dried autumn leaves, cola, baking spices and red currants, while the palate slaps you in the face with vice-like tannins and tart, mouth-puckering acidity. A bitter oak finish, without the fruit or structure doesn't hold it all together.\n48284\tAustralia\tFirst Eleven\t92\t60\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJim Barry 2005 First Eleven Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tJim Barry\tGT_90_Points\tJim Barry's Cab program is on a roll, turning out a consistent set of wines from Clare and Coonawarra. Named in honor of the Australian cricket team, The First Eleven boasts a kaledioscopic range of berry fruit, accented by mint and darker notes of coffee, cocoa and cola. It's full-bodied and dense on the palate without being heavy, and finishes long, with impressive intensity and dusty tannins. Drink now–2020.\n232\tAustralia\tRed Belly Black\t85\t12\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tAngove's 2006 Red Belly Black Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tAngove's\tLT_90_Points\tLifted cedar and pine notes interspersed with appealing woodsy scents give way to a surprisingly intense palate that shows some nice peppery notes but ultimately falls short on the finish.

The 2002 still boasts youthful scents of fresh mint and cassis, then slowly unfolds on the palate to reveal a rich, full-bodied wine with a distinctly ripe, creamy texture. Long and powerful on the finish, with 10 or so years ahead of it.\n70696\tAustralia\tRichelieu\t90\t80\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCharles Melton 2009 Richelieu Grenache (South Australia)\tGrenache\tCharles Melton\tGT_90_Points\tAfter 26 months in French oak and additional time in bottle, this is a sumptuously silky Grenache.

Those berries are capably framed by cedary elements, but on the palate, the structure of the wine is taut, wiry and crisp. Drink it over the next few years for its fruity appeal.\n87768\tAustralia\tPrickly\t88\t11\tVictoria\tAlpine Valleys\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFrisk 2014 Prickly Riesling (Alpine Valleys)\tRiesling\tFrisk\tLT_90_Points\tLight, off-dry and refreshing, this would make an ideal poolside sipper.

It shows enough firmness to stand up to rich, fatty meats now, or to sustain it through up to a decade of cellaring.\n77044\tAustralia\tR Reserve\t95\t105\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKilikanoon 2009 R Reserve Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tKilikanoon\tGT_90_Points\tThe fruit for this offering comes from the Green's and Crowhurst vineyards. This wine brings a a sense of cellarworthiness, from the inky color and dense, impenetrable bouquet to the richly tannic palate and long, plushly textured finish. Right now, it delivers hints of toast and mint, blueberry and plum fruit and savory notes of roasted meat and mocha. Drink 2018–2025+.\n104047\tAustralia\tL- Block\t92\t60\tVictoria\tPyrenees\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDomaine Terlato & Chapoutier 2012 L- Block Shiraz (Pyrenees)\tShiraz\tDomaine Terlato & Chapoutier\tGT_90_Points\tThis partnership between the Rhône's Michel Chapoutier and his American importer seems remarkably consistent. Peppery clove aromas presage a medium-bodied, silky wine that combines spice with black olives on the midpalate. It's long, finely textured and espresso-tinged on the finish.\n109940\tAustralia\tSt Andrews\t93\t60\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWakefield 2014 St Andrews Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tWakefield\tGT_90_Points\tWakefield (known as Taylor's in Australia) was founded as a Cabernet-focused estate. While the range has expanded over time, Cabernet Sauvignon remains a strength. Brown sugar and cedar frame cassis fruit on the nose; the palate shows just enough juicy, mouthwatering fruit to support the ample oak. This is full bodied yet supple, with crisp acids showing on the finish.\n58030\tAustralia\tThe McRae Wood\t90\t52\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJim Barry 2013 The McRae Wood Shiraz (Clare Valley)\tShiraz\tJim Barry\tGT_90_Points\tThis medium-bodied shiraz is remarkably fresh and vibrant, deftly blending maple syrup and smoke with red berries, then easing into a firm, dusty finish.

Dried spices and mixed berries include hints of clove and cracked pepper, finishing with some dry, chewy tannins. The assemblage is 49% Grenache, 29% Shiraz and 22% Mourvèdre.

The 2008 Hickinbotham is full bodied and velvety in texture, with ample notes of cocoa and crisp cassis. Hints of mint and other herbal shadings give it varietal character and welcome complexity. Drink it over the next 10–12 years.\n18637\tAustralia\tOld Block\t90\t70\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSt Hallett 2009 Old Block Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tSt Hallett\tGT_90_Points\tAlthough not nearly as flashy as many of its brethren, this is a well balanced Barossa Shiraz that could cellar well. Hints of mint accent the nose, bolstered by toasty oak, while the flavors feature red currants and raspberries. The acids are reasonably crisp given the context, lingering nicely on the finish. Fine to drink now, but try to save a few bottles until 2020 or so to see how it develops.\n3595\tAustralia\tEmeri Pink Moscato\t86\t13\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDe Bortoli NV Emeri Pink Moscato Sparkling (South Eastern Australia)\tSparkling Blend\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tA pleasant, sweet little sipper, with more richness than many Australian Moscatos, balanced through a slight touch of bitterness on the finish. Orange and spice notes are joined by just a faint hint of berry fruit.\n6035\tAustralia\tReserve\t89\t16\tSouth Australia\tLimestone Coast\t\t\t\tHeritage Road 1998 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Limestone Coast)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tHeritage Road\tLT_90_Points\tBlackberry, herb, tobacco and a menthol note mark the nose of this full but not heavy red. The fruit is ripe, sweet and unburdened by excess oak. The long, juicy cherry and licorice finish sports no hard tannins. Lovely for drinking now.\n45763\tAustralia\t\t83\t\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\t\t\tAntipodean 1999 Chardonnay (Eden Valley)\tChardonnay\tAntipodean\tLT_90_Points\tYellow fruit dominates the palate, which also has an unusual powdery mouthfeel.

It's a plump, amply endowed version of this wine, but may not be as long lived as some other vintages. Drink now–2010.\n49848\tAustralia\t\t86\t20\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWest Cape Howe 2008 Pinot Noir (Western Australia)\tPinot Noir\tWest Cape Howe\tLT_90_Points\tA slightly chunky, sturdy rendition of Pinot Noir, with earthy complex notes ranging from beet root and cola through sous bois and animale.

Slightly jammy raspberry fruit is coated in chocolate; even the tannins come across as softly dusty, even vaguely cocoa-like. Drink over the next year or two.\n57776\tAustralia\t\t88\t95\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYarra Yering 2008 Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)\tPinot Noir\tYarra Yering\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine's dark root beer and cola notes surround a core of plummy fruit. There's ample body and richness, supported by soft tannins and crisp acids, but the overall sense is one of immediate approachability.\n49586\tAustralia\tTiers Vineyard\t89\t120\tSouth Australia\tPiccadilly Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPetaluma 1999 Tiers Vineyard Chardonnay (Piccadilly Valley)\tChardonnay\tPetaluma\tLT_90_Points\tAt this price, it would be hard for this wine to live up to expectations—which is why we taste blind. But without any preconceptions, this wine was still delicious. The promising oaky aromas of honey drizzled over toast, coconut and vanilla are backed by white peach. It's tightly wound and less giving on the palate.\n32298\tAustralia\t\t88\t15\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tNick Faldo 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tNick Faldo\tLT_90_Points\tAre golfer-inspired wines the next big thing? First came Greg Norman, then Ernie Els, now there's Nick Faldo. Made by Katnook Estate, this is a dark, plushly textured wine that's immediately accessible.

It then grows more refined and understated on the palate, where the flavors are white peach, melon and citrus.\n59442\tAustralia\tDragon\t85\t14\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tXanadu 2006 Dragon Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tXanadu\tLT_90_Points\tAn effusively fruity, unoaked style of Chardonnay, with bold flavors of pear, apple and citrus and maybe even a touch of mango. Its charms are upfront for all to see, as it loses a bit of intensity and lacks length on the finish.\n116378\tAustralia\t\t85\t14\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tNugan Family Estates 2005 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)\tShiraz\tNugan Family Estates\tLT_90_Points\tStarts with aromas of clove, coffee and black olive, then adds brighter flavors of red berries on the palate before picking up some tea-like notes and a hint of chocolate on the finish.

It's plump on the midpalate, then almost razor-sharp on the finish. Drink now.\n36335\tAustralia\tTwo Lands\t87\t15\tAustralia Other\tAustralia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJacob's Creek 2015 Two Lands Pinot Grigio (Australia)\tPinot Grigio\tJacob's Creek\tLT_90_Points\tLoaded with ripe pear, muskmelon and tropical fruit, this is a medium-bodied, plump white with crowd appeal.

Scents of petrichor and fresh flower-shop greenery mingle easily on the nose, while the crispness of the high-acid backbone resounds on the palate, ending on a talc-like note.\n108665\tAustralia\tSt. Henri\t94\t65\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenfolds 2008 St. Henri Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tPenfolds\tGT_90_Points\tLike virtually all of Penfolds' top-end reds, this is full bodied and densely concentrated. As it's aged solely in large vats, there's no oak influence and the wine needs a bit of bottle age to come around. For now, it's a bit monolithic, showing hints of mint, black olive and ripe raspberries before ending long and fine. Drink 2017–2030, and perhaps beyond.\n98184\tAustralia\tDiamond Label\t86\t10\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRosemount 2011 Diamond Label Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)\tChardonnay\tRosemount\tLT_90_Points\tHarkens back to the value days of the Diamond Label—but the style has been updated to reflect more freshness and focus.

In another few years it may settle down, but for now the overall impression is of a rather rough customer that's best suited to be poured alongside grilled steak.\n49702\tAustralia\tPrelude Vineyards\t91\t36\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeeuwin Estate 2011 Prelude Vineyards Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tLeeuwin Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThis may be the best vintage of this wine yet.

On first opening, it's mute on the nose and simply earthy and dull on the palate, with a dry, dusty finish. Later on, it opened up some and showed some nice aged fruit as well, then shut down again. —J.C.\n62213\tAustralia\t\t87\t14\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tShoofly 2013 Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)\tPinot Noir\tShoofly\tLT_90_Points\tA solid value, the 2013 Shoofly is an open-knit, savory wine for drinking over the next year or two. Cola and earth predominate, dressed up by hints of dried spices and green coffee bean.\n12257\tAustralia\tYattarna\t92\t65\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\t\t\tPenfolds 1998 Yattarna Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)\tChardonnay\tPenfolds\tGT_90_Points\tThis big wine presents a sophisticated bouquet of toasty, leesy, nutty aromas. Fine depth of fruit and plenty of quality oak show here, with butterscotch, pear and apple flavors. Full-bodied and luscious, it shows the tremendous attention paid and importance assigned to this flagship white. The long, spicy finish sports complex lemon, leesy and mineral accents. To be released 5/01.\n91355\tAustralia\t\t91\t20\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\t3 Rings 2013 Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\t3 Rings\tGT_90_Points\tLush and creamy in texture, this shows just how good some relatively inexpensive Barossa Shiraz can be. Elements of graham cracker, espresso, dark chocolate and baking spices are bolstered by ample weight and berry fruit. Enjoy this velvety wine over the short term—by 2018 or so.\n119994\tAustralia\tThree Gardens\t92\t20\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLangmeil 2012 Three Gardens Red (Barossa)\tRed Blend\tLangmeil\tGT_90_Points\tThis is nearly equal parts Shiraz, Mataro and Grenache, full bodied and creamy in texture. Black cherries and peppery spice show up on the nose, while the palate adds brighter red raspberries, bass notes of ripe plums, sweet hints of brown sugar and savory, meaty complexity. Drink now–2020.\n89449\tAustralia\t\t90\t18\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWest Cape Howe 2006 Shiraz (Western Australia)\tShiraz\tWest Cape Howe\tGT_90_Points\tRoasted meat, floral notes, peppery spice...sounds rather nice. Add in silky tannins, hints of coffee and blueberry and a long finish, and you have a pretty wine at a realistic price.

Dark berry fruit, vanilla and cedar mark the nose, while there's plenty of weight and richness on the palate. Drink now–2025.\n39691\tAustralia\tCowaramup\t93\t54\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCherubino 2010 Cowaramup Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCherubino\tGT_90_Points\tCowaramup is a Margaret River subregion. A herbal note adds interest to the aromas, and some lifted red fruit sets this wine apart from Cherubino's other 2010 Cabernets. Otherwise, it's pretty similar in its lavish oaking and meaty, savory flavors, but with a bright, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2020.\n75364\tAustralia\tGraveyard Vineyard\t91\t125\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBrokenwood 2007 Graveyard Vineyard Shiraz (Hunter Valley)\tShiraz\tBrokenwood\tGT_90_Points\tOne of the Hunter Valley's top bottlings, Brokenwood's Graveyard Vineyard is still marked by hints of toasty oak at this young stage in its evolution. Vanilla accents lifted sour cherry and cranberry aromas, but on the palate the flavors darken and deepen, trending toward black cherries and plum. Has a nicely balanced, silky texture in the mouth, then a firm, long finish suggesting cellaring. Drink 2012-2025.\n113817\tAustralia\tReserve\t90\t50\tSouth Australia\tLimestone Coast\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGreg Norman Estates 2001 Reserve Shiraz (Limestone Coast)\tShiraz\tGreg Norman Estates\tGT_90_Points\tAt seven years of age, this is a reasonably complex wine, well suited to pair with roasts. The ample oak is integrated with the fruit, yielding a mélange of nuances that include grilled meat, cedar, vanilla, dried spices, coffee, black olives, blackberries and tar. Drink now–2015.\n46915\tAustralia\tVintage Cuvée\t93\t44\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJansz 2010 Vintage Cuvée Sparkling (Tasmania)\tSparkling Blend\tJansz\tGT_90_Points\tThis rivals good Champagne in its toasty, buttery-brioche richness, then adds cashew and citrus for an assertive blast of balanced flavor. Drink this fine vintage sparkler over the next 10 years or so.\n18468\tAustralia\t\t92\t28\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tEss & See 2014 Tempranillo (South Australia)\tTempranillo\tEss & See\tGT_90_Points\tDespite the broad South Australia appellation listed on the label, this small-batch wine is from a single vineyard located between Barossa and the Adelaide Hills. It's meaty and stalky, with raisiny dark fruit, cocoa powder and Dr. Pepper notes. The palate changes directions but is equally delicious in juicy cranberry, earth and herbs, with tightly grained tannins and lively acidity.\n104235\tAustralia\tFounder's Block\t90\t35\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKatnook Estate 2014 Founder's Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tKatnook Estate\tGT_90_Points\tIt's been some time since Katnook last submitted samples, so it's reassuring to see that quality there remains high. This medium-bodied Cabernet boasts crisp acids and fine tannins, highlighting notes of red currants, olives and bay leaves. Drink now–2025.\n12857\tAustralia\tThe Noble\t91\t19\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2006 The Noble Chardonnay-Semillon (Adelaide)\tChardonnay-Semillon\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tThis intriguing stickie is predominantly (94%) Chardonnay—an unusual choice for a botrytized wine. Dried apricot and ripe pear aromas lead the way, with the flavors leaning toward intensely honeyed apricot preserves. It's full-bodied, lush and candy-sweet, with a mouthcoating finish.\n59821\tAustralia\tTiers Vineyard\t93\t70\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTapaNappa 2006 Tiers Vineyard Chardonnay (South Australia)\tChardonnay\tTapaNappa\tGT_90_Points\tBrian Croser's efforts with Tiers Vineyard Chardonnay have finally paid off in a big way. This is a plump, amply textured wine that doesn't lack for elegance, marrying scents and flavors of toasted grain with white peaches and hazelnuts. Long and intense on the finish, echoing with toasty oak but also layers of vibrant fruit. Drink now–2015.\n115853\tAustralia\t\t91\t20\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCape Mentelle 2016 Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River)\tSauvignon Blanc-Semillon\tCape Mentelle\tGT_90_Points\tThis is Cape Mentelle's biggest selling wine in the U.S., and one taste makes it clear why. It's got some of the herbal and passion fruit notes of Sauvignon Blanc, balanced by the strong citrus of Semillon. It's clean, crisp and long on the finish, with a lightly silky texture that lingers. Drink now.\n116345\tAustralia\tCabernet Shiraz Merlot\t87\t9\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tIronberry 2005 Cabernet Shiraz Merlot Red (Western Australia)\tRed Blend\tIronberry\tLT_90_Points\tComes out of the chute showing a funky, rubbery edge, but that blows off with a little time to reveal dark, somewhat earthy notes of cola and blackberry. It's medium-bodied, with good length to the finish, where it picks up enough dusty tannins to give it backbone.\n51267\tAustralia\t\t90\t20\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRobert Oatley 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tRobert Oatley\tGT_90_Points\tA sculpted, refined expresion of Cabernet Sauvignon, Oatley's 2010 combines hints of mint and dark berries into a wine that offers clean, pure fruit, subtle oak shadings and a long, silky finish.

Perhaps because such miniscule quantities are available (30 cases of the 2005 Quintet). The 2005 Quintet presents as a medium-bodied, nicely rounded Bordeaux-style blend, marrying cedary, meaty notes with cherry fruit and graced with touches of cinnamon and mushroom. It's nicely balanced and reasonably complex; ready to drink now.\n64708\tAustralia\t\t89\t17\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWakefield 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tWakefield\tLT_90_Points\tWakefield (known as Taylors in Australia) was founded in Clare with the goal of producing world-class Cabernet Sauvignon, so it's no surprise this wine is a solid effort. Cassis and black-tea notes are carried easily by the medium body and dusty tannins that turn silkier on the finish. Drink now–2025.\n123\tAustralia\tParson's Flat\t92\t40\tSouth Australia\tPadthaway\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenry's Drive Vignerons 2006 Parson's Flat Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Padthaway)\tShiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon\tHenry's Drive Vignerons\tGT_90_Points\tThe blend is roughly two-thirds Shiraz and one-third Cabernet, and the result combines berries with cassis and generosity with structure, all framed by toasty oak. Savory in character, long and dusty on the finish. Drink now-2018.\n6986\tAustralia\tStamp of Australia\t86\t8\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\t\t\tHardys 2014 Stamp of Australia Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)\tShiraz\tHardys\tLT_90_Points\tThere's a fair lick of dried wood notes on this straightforward sipper. The fruity strawberry and blueberry core is plush and pleasing, as is the soft grip of tannins at the backend.\n122690\tAustralia\tScarlet Ladybird Single Site\t88\t15\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tZonte's Footstep 2010 Scarlet Ladybird Single Site Rosé (South Australia)\tRosé\tZonte's Footstep\tLT_90_Points\tCloser in style to a light red wine than a traditional dry rosé, this is dark pink—nearly pomegranate—in color, and boasts hints of leather, berries, dried herbs and white chocolate. Textured and round in the mouth, the only quibble is its relatively quick fade on the finish. Drink now.\n45809\tAustralia\tAstralis\t95\t225\tSouth Australia\tClarendon\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tClarendon Hills 2007 Astralis Syrah (Clarendon)\tSyrah\tClarendon Hills\tGT_90_Points\tThe 2007 Astralis impresses for its combination of power and nuance. It's dark and almost tarry in concentration, but floral and bright at the same time. Layers of dark coffee and earth are balanced by red fruit, and although it's full bodied and rich in texture, the finish introduces delicately herbal, tea-like notes. Best from 2014–2025.\n22419\tAustralia\tReiver\t88\t55\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMitolo 2007 Reiver Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tMitolo\tLT_90_Points\tThis vintage of the Reiver seems mintier than others, and at times the mint seemed a dominant feature of this wine, which otherwise offers jammy berry fruit and chocolate aromas and flavors. At 15% abv, it's not a shy wine, but neither is it as richly textured as might be expected. Drink it 2013–2020.\n119478\tAustralia\t\t83\t9\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGumdale 2010 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)\tChardonnay\tGumdale\tLT_90_Points\tThe darkening color and honeyed, butterscotch-like aromas suggest a wine that is entering decline. There's still enough peach and mango fruit to give it some interest, but drink up.\n86896\tAustralia\tBlack Label\t86\t8\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMcGuigan 2000 Black Label Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)\tChardonnay\tMcGuigan\tLT_90_Points\tFilled with bouncy aromas of melon, pear and tropical fruit, this lightweight charmer even blends in notes of butter and anise on the finish. It's a fun wine with the accent on fruit. Best Buy.\n49720\tAustralia\tOld Vine\t91\t32\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYangarra Estate Vineyard 2011 Old Vine Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tYangarra Estate Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a concentrated, firmly built example of Grenache, with herbal overtones to its black cherry fruit. Despite the dark plum and cherry fruit, the impression is one of tautness and freshness. Drink it with red meat now, or give it until 2017 to settle down.\n81989\tAustralia\t\t91\t19\tVictoria\tRutherglen\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCampbells NV Muscat (Rutherglen)\tMuscat\tCampbells\tGT_90_Points\tDelicately floral on the nose, this sweet but wonderfully balanced Muscat offers a fine introduction to the Rutherglen Muscat style. Pineapple, raisin and spice flavors persist a good long time, trailing elegantly away on the finish.\n91633\tAustralia\t\t92\t15\tVictoria\tGrampians\t\t\t\tPoint Ormond 2015 Sangiovese (Grampians)\tSangiovese\tPoint Ormond\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine is spot on with the modern Aussie movement towards light-bodied, moderate-alcohol wines, with little to no oak influence. From the cool climes of Western Victoria, this is downright delicious and a total bargain. Bright, ripe red cherry, chocolate, cola and violet notes lead into a plush yet zingy palate of juicy red fruits, silky soft tannins and a long tangy finish.\n82407\tAustralia\tOld Vine\t88\t32\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYangarra Estate Vineyard 2013 Old Vine Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tYangarra Estate Vineyard\tLT_90_Points\tMatured in used French barriques, this nevertheless shows touches of toast and cedar alongside tart, fruit notes of cranberry and raspberry. It's full bodied and richly tannic, with crisp acids that accentuate the tannins on the finish. Drink 2020–2030.\n75357\tAustralia\tJimmy Section\t91\t37\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tOliverhill 2008 Jimmy Section Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tOliverhill\tGT_90_Points\tOliverhill seems to have hit the mark in 2008 with their Jimmy Section Shiraz, a seamless blend of blueberries and cream dressed up with savory notes of dark earth and dark coffee. Full-bodied and creamy textured, this densely concentrated wine should be at its best now-2020.\n5301\tAustralia\t\t88\t10\tAustralia Other\tCentral Ranges\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRolling 2009 Shiraz (Central Ranges)\tShiraz\tRolling\tLT_90_Points\tDespite the inexpensive price tag, this is a solid Shiraz, offering ripe black cherry fruit and touches of tree bark and orris root. It's medium-bodied, yet features a velvety texture and plenty of length on the finish. Drink now–2015.\n60750\tAustralia\t\t89\t12\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMilton Park 2009 Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tMilton Park\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine may lack the dramatic power of its top-flight brethren, but it still satisfies, delivering reasonably complex notes of cherries, rhubarb and olive carried by silky tannins and moderate alcohol. Drink this terrific value over the next year or two.\n36652\tAustralia\tArt Series\t92\t60\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeeuwin Estate 2012 Art Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tLeeuwin Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThe Art Series Cabernet seems to be increasing in quality nearly every vintage. The 2012 boasts plenty of sweet, cedary oak, but backs that up with layers of red currant fruit and hints of bay leaf. It's silky and harmonious on the finish, adding tea-like notes of complexity. Drink now–2025.\n34120\tAustralia\tThe Château 100 Year Old Vines\t93\t100\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChâteau Tanunda 2010 The Château 100 Year Old Vines Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tChâteau Tanunda\tGT_90_Points\tThis full-bodied yet silky Shiraz delivers tremendous elegance for its size. It's complex as well, boasting aromas that range from vanilla and brown sugar through to marinated beef and raspberry compote. The richly-textured finish lingers for minutes. Drink now–2025.\n113055\tAustralia\t\t90\t17\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWakefield 2015 Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tWakefield\tGT_90_Points\tThis offers the vinous elements of fruit cocktail, combining hints of peach, pear and citrus in the glass. That fruit mélange tightens up on the finish, reined in by an extra squirt of mouthwatering lime.\n100393\tAustralia\tThe Factor\t92\t105\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2006 The Factor Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tOld-vine Shiraz from the valley floor imparts great richness and a creamy texture to this wine's tannins, framed easily by hints of vanilla. Yet it's not a simple fruit-and-oak concoction—with time in the glass it steadily unfurls to reveal herbal and spice complexities. Marries power and elegance;  drink now–2015.\n72735\tAustralia\tTate\t90\t15\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFranklin Tate 2013 Tate Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tFranklin Tate\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a pretty lean, tightly focused wine. Grilled pineapple and citrus notes broaden slightly on the midpalate, then come together again on the crisp, lemony finish. Drink now through the end of 2015.\n95081\tAustralia\tDry Land\t90\t25\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tReilly's 2007 Dry Land Shiraz (Clare Valley)\tShiraz\tReilly's\tGT_90_Points\tReilly's 2007 Dry Land Shiraz is full bodied and velvety textured without being overbearing—trademark attributes of Clare Valley Shiraz. It delivers superripe cherries but wraps them in a cocoon of spicy, savory complexity and soft tannins. Drink now-2017.\n7387\tAustralia\tBrookman\t92\t75\tSouth Australia\tClarendon\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tClarendon Hills 2008 Brookman Syrah (Clarendon)\tSyrah\tClarendon Hills\tGT_90_Points\tThe 2008 Brookman Syrah is a rich, plush, luxurious wine. Aromas of cedar, vanilla and black cherry set the stage, while the palate features intense dark fruit layered with hints of olive and coffee. It's full bodied and creamy in texture, showing just a touch of warmth on the supple finish. Drink now–2020.\n77796\tAustralia\tLuna\t91\t18\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWit's End 2014 Luna Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tWit's End\tGT_90_Points\tA splash of Barbera enlivens this wine, which boasts boysenberry, understated earthy notes and a dash of vanilla. The tannins are firm, suggesting at least 10 years of ageability.\n58226\tAustralia\tBlack Label\t90\t70\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWolf Blass 2002 Black Label Red (South Australia)\tRed Blend\tWolf Blass\tGT_90_Points\tThere's nothing to dislike about the 30th anniversary release of this iconic Australian wine—only the price is hard to swallow. Cedar, earth and mint frame the nose, while the dark-fruit and rich cola flavors ease across the palate in a wave of creamy tannins. It even firms up a little on the finish; could age until 2020.\n27189\tAustralia\t\t90\t12\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRazor's Edge 2008 Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tRazor's Edge\tGT_90_Points\tA terrific value if you like the style, this is an impressively concentrated, slightly syrupy Shiraz imbued with potent cassis fruit and framed with vanilla oak.

This is a big, brash Shiraz, screaming with vanilla and mixed berry flavors, yet the result is some kind of harmony, even with the volume turned up to 11. It's full bodied and plushly textured, with a long, layered finish. Delicious now and over the five years or more.\n43397\tAustralia\tDiamond Label\t83\t12\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRosemount 2001 Diamond Label Pinot Noir (South Eastern Australia)\tPinot Noir\tRosemount\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a bigger, more forceful wine than its Lindemans stablemate, but not quite as charming. The flavors are earthy and dark, featuring hints of cola and root beer. Finishes with drying tannins. —J.C.\n124742\tAustralia\tUnoaked\t84\t19\tSouth Australia\tPadthaway\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJip Jip Rocks 2014 Unoaked Chardonnay (Padthaway)\tChardonnay\tJip Jip Rocks\tLT_90_Points\tDespite being unoaked, this is a weighty wine, with a thick, viscous texture and simple, tangy flavors of canned pineapple. Drink it well chilled.\n22616\tAustralia\tThe Chook\t89\t20\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tThe Black Chook 2015 The Chook Shiraz-Viognier (South Australia)\tShiraz-Viognier\tThe Black Chook\tLT_90_Points\tGive this wine a brief stay in a decanter to help blow off some of the tarry notes and it should be fine. It's full-bodied and creamy, with mocha and black-fruit flavors that finish plush and soft. Drink now.\n12779\tAustralia\tReeves Point\t90\t28\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tJacob's Creek 2005 Reeves Point Chardonnay (South Australia)\tChardonnay\tJacob's Creek\tGT_90_Points\tA few years of age have turned this South Australia Chardonnay into a highly nuanced tipple. Kerosene, hay and coconut aromas play off fragrant blood orange scents while the palate offers up toast and caramel in a tight, well-defined structure. Try with grilled salmon or serve on its own. Drinking at its peak now but will last a few more years.\n10551\tAustralia\tMort's Reserve\t89\t35\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKilikanoon 2013 Mort's Reserve Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tKilikanoon\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a lean, austere—even a bit severe—Riesling that looks to need a good five years or more to mellow. Crushed stone and citrus pith finish long and painfully tart.\n15762\tAustralia\t\t88\t19\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKoonowla 2007 Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tKoonowla\tLT_90_Points\tSmells just gorgeous, combining classic lime sherbet notes with hints of petrol and fleurs blanches. But in the mouth it lacks the same finesse, and shows a riper, chunkier character that leans toward pineapple and peach. It's still very good, but don't expect it to age well past 5 or 6 years.\n45753\tAustralia\t\t84\t7\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\t\t\tBlue Tongue 2002 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)\tChardonnay\tBlue Tongue\tLT_90_Points\tThough it's 100% Chardonnay, this wine doesn't taste particularly Chard-like: it has light floral and stone fruit notes more akin to a Riesling. It's a lightweight in the mouth, rounded out by a little creaminess. A decent, economical choice to quaff on a hot day.\n89263\tAustralia\tEstate\t93\t55\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKooyong 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Mornington Peninsula)\tPinot Noir\tKooyong\tGT_90_Points\tLike many Mornington producers, Kooyong has a relatively short track record (founded 1996). For much of that time, winemaking was under the guidance of Sandro Mosele, including this stunning 2012. It shows Burgundian levels of complexity in its array of smoke, leather, root vegetable and black cherry notes, then backs that all up with a firm-yet-supple texture and tremendous length. Drink now through 2022.\n74850\tAustralia\t\t90\t21\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRocland Estate 2008 Grenache (Barossa Valley)\tGrenache\tRocland Estate\tGT_90_Points\tSuperripe fruit, befitting a hot year, suggests early consumption may be the best option for this supple, luscious wine. There's bits of spicy, leathery complexity to go with the intense black cherry fruit. Drink now–2013.\n50468\tAustralia\tThoroughbred\t87\t28\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tStanley Lambert 2002 Thoroughbred Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tStanley Lambert\tLT_90_Points\tSupple and velvety, with a ripe, creamy texture, this shows textbook Cab flavors: cassis, tobacco and some vanilla from new oak. It deftly avoids the common Barossa problem of excessive size and weight, just could use a touch more persistence on the finish. Imported by AUSA Pacific, LLC.\n85226\tAustralia\t\t88\t30\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTar & Roses 2007 Shiraz (Heathcote)\tShiraz\tTar & Roses\tLT_90_Points\tDark berries or plums, cedar and spice notes sum up the aromas and flavors you can expect from this Heathcote Shiraz. It's medium to full in body, and while it's not overly lush, neither is it overly lean—making it a balanced drink with moderate complexity. The firm finish suggests cellaring another year or two, or pairing it with grilled or roasted meats.\n123130\tAustralia\tThe Ratbag\t84\t18\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHugh Hamilton 2005 The Ratbag Merlot (McLaren Vale)\tMerlot\tHugh Hamilton\tLT_90_Points\tThe Ratbag makes for a pleasant, if somewhat generic dry red. Dried fruit and prune notes are complemented by chocolate overtones and the mouthfeel is soft and user-friendly.\n107846\tAustralia\tCuthbert Amery Vineyard\t93\t60\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKay Brothers 2012 Cuthbert Amery Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tKay Brothers\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine starts off with an appetizing, savory, grilled-meat element on the nose, then showcases flavors of dark chocolate, mocha and plum. It's hefty on the palate, with a velvety texture and long, rich finish.

The aromas and flavors are classic this year, seamlessly marrying cassis and cedar, but finishing dry, astringent and firm.

It's medium in body and rather lean, with a crisp, fully dry finish. The blend is 69% Sauvignon Blanc, 31% Semillon.\n85056\tAustralia\t\t89\t125\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMount Mary 2006 Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)\tPinot Noir\tMount Mary\tLT_90_Points\tRestraint is one of the buzzwords in Australian wine, which might be one reason that for all of this winery's cult status in Australia, it remains relatively unknown in America. This medium-bodied wine's black cherry fruit is definitely restrained, flecked with delicate herbal notes and rounded out by supple tannins. It's well made and well balanced, but lacks sizzle.\n66253\tAustralia\t\t91\t39\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJosef Chromy 2013 Pinot Noir (Tasmania)\tPinot Noir\tJosef Chromy\tGT_90_Points\tSome whole-bunch fermentation is reflected in a vegetal hint on the nose, but otherwise this is a fruit-driven youngster, bursting with lively red berries. Hints of toasted coconut, vanilla and mocha from French oak add complexity to this medium-bodied, supple wine. The tannins firm up on the finish, suggesting mid-term cellaring; drink 2017–2023.\n40919\tAustralia\t\t90\t16\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPeter Lehmann 2006 Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tPeter Lehmann\tGT_90_Points\tThis nicely balanced Barossa Shiraz shows that not all Barossa wines are overweight.

It succeeds admirably, albeit without the intensity and complexity that marks the best Barossan Shirazes, combining raspberries with touches of plum and prune before turning chocolaty on the finish.

Mouthfilling but dry on the finish, this is still very young; decant if serving now, or try 2013-2020.\n61464\tAustralia\tThe Dead Arm\t90\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2010 The Dead Arm Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tThe Dead Arm is always firmly structured, making it one of the more challenging Shiraz to judge in its youth. The 2010 is full-bodied and chewy, characterized by dark, earthy and umami notes of roasted meat, asphalt and grilled mushrooms. The length and ripely tannic nature of the finish is reassuring. Drink 2018–2030.\n19735\tAustralia\tQuandong Farm Single Vineyard\t92\t32\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPaxton 2014 Quandong Farm Single Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tPaxton\tGT_90_Points\tThis sees less new oak than the Jones Block, so the quality of the biodynamically grown fruit shines. Herbal notes reminiscent of rosemary and thyme accent raspberry and cherry fruit, and while there's ample weight and ripeness, the overall impression is of drinkability and ease.\n39370\tAustralia\t\t91\t25\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\t5OS Project 2014 Montepulciano (South Australia)\tMontepulciano\t5OS Project\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine shows a grape jelly note that might be a little on the ripe side, but the cedary, cigar box characters balance things out beautifully. The palate is medium bodied, with a long line of focused acidity, herbs, an earthy core and a long cigar-box finish.\n69018\tAustralia\tThe Beauty\t91\t50\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHentley Farm 2007 The Beauty Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tHentley Farm\tGT_90_Points\tOnly slightly less rich than its Beast counterpart, the 2007 Beauty is a full-bodied wine nonetheless.

Vanilla and custardy notes mark the nose, while the flavors turn toasty and cereal-like, backed by plenty of mixed citrus fruit. It's not overly rich or ripe, but has long, mouthwatering finish.\n97335\tAustralia\t\t88\t13\tNew South Wales\tSouthern Highlands\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCuttaway Hill Estate 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Southern Highlands)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCuttaway Hill Estate\tLT_90_Points\tFrom a higher elevation—and hence cooler—region of Australia, this is a light to medium-bodied Cabernet that avoids excessive leanness, offering up a mélange of plump cassis, leather and tobacco. It's not the most powerful Cab, but offers elegance and length at an affordable price.\n70881\tAustralia\tThe d'Arry's Original\t90\t19\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2006 The d'Arry's Original Shiraz-Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz-Grenache\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tThe 2006 d'Arry's Original offers a welcome combination of dark, earthy complexity with notes of cola, plum and black cherry.

Syrupy, intense aromas of coffee and dark chocolate make an immediate impact on the nose, followed by syrupy, intense flavors of coffee and molasses. There's mind-boggling concentration here, but just enough acidity to provide a sense of balance.

The 2011 Art Series is flamboyantly oaked, with smoky, toasty, nutty notes layered over hints of white peach and grilled pineapple.

Undoubtedly there's some fruit in support, which fills out the wine's frame and adds some firm tannins to the mix, providing for potential longevity. The only question is whether it will hold up in the long term.\n49806\tAustralia\tScotsdale\t91\t37\tWestern Australia\tGreat Southern\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHoward Park 2013 Scotsdale Cabernet Sauvignon (Great Southern)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tHoward Park\tGT_90_Points\tDark chocolate and cedar merge easily on the nose of this medium- to full-bodied wine.

It opens up into a broad mid-palate, showing well-balanced nuances of olive and earth, fresh herb, pepper and licorice.

It could almost pass for a cru Beaujolais, from the slightly candied cherry fruit right down to the hints of banana that suggest a certain amount of whole cluster fermentation. In any event, it's fruity, lightly detailed with spice, and quite charming, though not as substantial as its 2006 predecessor.\n94502\tUS\tMarguerite Vineyard\t89\t21\tCalifornia\tAnderson Valley\t\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tPhilo Ridge 2012 Marguerite Vineyard Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley)\tPinot Gris\tPhilo Ridge\tLT_90_Points\tAnderson Valley has always been a hospitable home to Pinot Gris and this 100% tank-fermented, no-malolactic-fermentation beauty is fragrant in orange blossom and honeysuckle, a tangible streak of wet stone zipping throughout.

That's reflected in the ripeness and fullness on the palate. It's a fruit-driven vintage, and this matches it perfectly with strawberry preserves, enhanced with streaks of cola, sassafras and coffee grounds. Mineral-drenched acids provide the perfect support.\n91557\tUS\t\t88\t14\tCalifornia\tMendocino County\t\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tBonterra 2014 Chardonnay (Mendocino County)\tChardonnay\tBonterra\tLT_90_Points\tA rather deep, brassy color and very buttery aromas make this wine stand out.

The flavors leap out now, and are all about ripe, crushed blackberries, red and black currants, anise and sweet, smoky cedar. Yet there's a tannic interference that's a little hard and astringent.

From the Pines Vineyard, planted around a century ago, revived in the 1980s, these wines have a power and unique presence that sets them apart from Zin from anywhere else. Ultraripe fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, alcohol above 15%, amazing density and beautifully managed tannins, with some sweet grain flavors that say “old vines.”\n2667\tUS\tVintage Brut\t90\t45\tCalifornia\tYountville\tNapa\t\t\tChandon 2008 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Yountville)\tSparkling Blend\tChandon\tGT_90_Points\tThis sparkling wine is one of the best from Chandon in years.

The aromas are wound up tightly at present but with coaxing reveal notes of French oak spices, black cherry and black currant.

It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac, thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron, cedar, licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense, but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry, cassis and mountain berry flavor. Woodward Canyon's red wines age beautifully, but if drunk young give them a lot of breathing time.\n100868\tUS\tReserve\t91\t30\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tVilla San Juliette 2013 Reserve Alicante Bouschet (Paso Robles)\tAlicante Bouschet\tVilla San Juliette\tGT_90_Points\tRich caramel and fudge tones mix with inviting crushed purple flowers, baked blackberries and vanilla on the nose of this bottling that features a red-fleshed grape rarely used alone.

It's mouthfilling and rich, but brisk cranberry acidity lends firm structure. The palate is subtly nuanced, marked by soft tannins and layers of brambly wood, cedar and baking spice. Aged 19 months with a large proportion of new French oak, it drinks well now but should meld beautifully from 2020–2028.\n92584\tUS\t\t90\t25\tWashington\tHorse Heaven Hills\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tChateau Ste.

Full body, velvety texture and soft acidity make it plush on the palate, helping the rich finish linger. Although it was aged in French barriques—two-thirds new—it's by no means an overoaked wine.\n30693\tUS\tEstate Grown\t85\t10\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tStoneCap 2011 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))\tChardonnay\tStoneCap\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine is slightly spritzy and sugary, with simple yet clean apple flavors.

You can taste the cool climate in the brisk acidity that frames this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. It's very ripe in blackberries, with rich layers of toast from new French oak. For all the sweet fruit, the finish is dry, even rasping. Such are the tannins that the wine feels tough, even at this age.

Scents and flavors of rose petals mingle with a lightly soapy, oily, broad midpalate that floats along on a bed of flowers, stone fruits, toast, hazelnuts, caramel and stone. A splash of everything, but it comes together in a seductive, open framework with just enough acid to support it.\n61268\tUS\tEstate Grown Redwood Retreat Vineyards\t87\t40\tCalifornia\tSanta Cruz Mountains\tCentral Coast\t\t\tFernwood 2007 Estate Grown Redwood Retreat Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tFernwood\tLT_90_Points\tYou'll find thick tannins and soft acidity in this wine, which offers direct, jammy blackberry and cassis flavors.

Tasted in January, it's enormous in sweet, jammy blackberries, melted milk chocolate, licorice, cherry pie filling and all kinds of peppery spices. Better sometime in 2010, and could become quite dramatic after that.\n23672\tUS\tBald Mountain Vineyard\t89\t32\tCalifornia\tBen Lomond Mountain\tCentral Coast\t\t\tSante Arcangeli 2012 Bald Mountain Vineyard Chardonnay (Ben Lomond Mountain)\tChardonnay\tSante Arcangeli\tLT_90_Points\tThis Chardonnay is almost Chablisian—it's bone dry, bristling with acidity, and modest in alcohol.

There's an enormous concentration of black currants and minerals, but the wine is immature in astringent tannins. Needs time, and possibly lots of it. Best 2011 and beyond.\n117554\tUS\tThe Conqueror Klipsun Vineyards\t88\t50\tWashington\tRed Mountain\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

The wine is fresh, fragrant and intensely floral, with a mix of rosewater and orange zest.

Immediately drinkable for the soft purity of the tannins and complex cassis, chocolate and oak flavors, it has the sturdy structure to develop for some years, but is best now for its elegant purity. Hess is on a real Cabernet roll, and is one of Napa's overlooked stars.\n40565\tUS\tBow Tie Vineyard Estate Grown\t90\t65\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tJ Vineyards & Winery 2013 Bow Tie Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tJ Vineyards & Winery\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a big, bold wine, full bodied with leathery tannin heat and a generous expression of blackberry and black-cherry cola.

It certainly appeals to the palate for its flashy sweetness, ripe in blackberries, raspberries, cherries and cocoa. And there's a generous overlay of oak. Still, it's hard to get past a certain directness. Your best bet is to stash it away and keep your fingers crossed over the next six years.\n127379\tUS\tWine Creek Ranch\t88\t26\tCalifornia\tDry Creek Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tQuivira 2009 Wine Creek Ranch Grenache (Dry Creek Valley)\tGrenache\tQuivira\tLT_90_Points\tA delightful bistro wine from a producer who's specialized in Rhône-style wines for decades.

It's dark and smoky, featuring an intriguing flavor mix of spun sugar and black cherry. It seems to hit a firm wall of toast and char that rounds out with some hours of breathing time.

The mouthfeel is slightly astringent, with hints of metal and stone, and the alcohol is muted, allowing the more subtle suggestions of citrus and beet and truffle and wild strawberry to emerge. All in all it's the most complex and intriguing of the winery's offerings, and merits your full attention.\n19775\tUS\tCruel Summer\t90\t22\tWashington\tColumbia Gorge (WA)\tWashington Other\tSean P.

It offers tantalizing citrus rind and peach fruit flavors, with a savory taste of cold minerals. Fans of rich, buttery Chardonnay will find it lean, but if you have a cellar, age it for six years and see how it evolves.\n62444\tUS\t\t92\t24\tCalifornia\tLodi\tCentral Valley\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tOak Farm 2015 Zinfandel (Lodi)\tZinfandel\tOak Farm\tGT_90_Points\tWonderful richness, depth and concentration make this full-bodied wine a standout.

Bright botanical aromas of mandarin orange rind, honeysuckle and pear give way to a zesty palate full of preserved citrus and marmalade flavors, all set against a firm structure and racy acidity.

The rigid tannins need a little more time to open, but the zesty blueberry, blackberry and black-pepper flavors shine across the fresh, sizzling acidity.\n106475\tUS\tSemi Dry\t85\t13\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tWagner 2008 Semi Dry Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)\tGewürztraminer\tWagner\tLT_90_Points\tOn the nose, this is a bit unique, offering unusual scents of pineapple, baked apple and white florals.

It's a big wine, full-bodied and very dry, with a long, spicy finish. Certainly packs a lot of flavor, with tons of blackberry jam, cassis and raisins. Has the inherent balance to age for a little while, so give it until 2015, but not much longer.\n106872\tUS\tEstate\t93\t75\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tSodaro 2008 Estate Red (Napa Valley)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tSodaro\tGT_90_Points\tThe majority Cab Sauvignon in the blend brings classic blackberry and cassis flavors, as well as firm tannins.

The increased percentage of Syrah and the extra dollop of Mourvèdre ramps this up to a stiffer, more substantial wine than the 2004. It's a Cabernet-driven complement to the DeLille D2, replete with muscle and nerve. Dark and chewy, the wine has picked up a little Rhône-like savage-ness from the Mourvèdre, especially in the aroma. The tannins are chewy and a bit leafy, and need some airing out, but there's plenty of meaty flavor here.\n95112\tUS\t\t89\t17\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C.

It's very fruity and floral, and the ripe citrus, peach, diesel and honeysuckle flavors are balanced by crisp acidity.\n116143\tUS\tBeckstoffer Missouri Hopper\t98\t250\tCalifornia\tOakville\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tAlpha Omega 2012 Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tAlpha Omega\tGT_90_Points\tFrom another of the grower's impressive, coveted sites, this wine imparts soft, dusty cherry, cassis and pomegranate notes, with a luxurious tease of vanilla and coconut macaroon. Full-bodied and robustly built, it's 100% varietal and barrel-fermented and finishes on a compelling streak of cedar, herb and graphite.\n12890\tUS\tBlueline Vineyard\t91\t125\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tHourglass 2009 Blueline Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tHourglass\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a big, tannic, midnight black Cabernet, rude in youth and barely drinkable. The tannins are powerful enough to lock down the palate. The grapes, grown in Calistoga, are very ripe in blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, but those tannins are stubbornly astringent. Almost old-fashioned in toughness despite very high alcohol, it's a curiosity that seems likely to develop in the cellar, but with so little evidence of past vintages, all bets are off.\n97992\tUS\t\t86\t20\tCalifornia\tCentral Coast\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tTenshen 2016 Rosé (Central Coast)\tRosé\tTenshen\tLT_90_Points\tOrange peel and raspberry aromas meet a touch of sourness on the nose of this bottling from Joey Tensley and Alex Guarachi, which comes after the label's more successful red and white wines.

The influence of barrels is felt more than tasted, but it does add a whisper of toast to the finish. Lively and fresh, this is a great wine for richer seafood.\n68973\tUS\tEstate\t91\t34\tCalifornia\tSanta Clara Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tJason-Stephens 2011 Estate Meritage (Santa Clara Valley)\tMeritage\tJason-Stephens\tGT_90_Points\tFrom the historic Uvas Creek area between Gilroy and Morgan Hill comes this solid bottling that shows black cherry, leather, dust and a slightly green element of oregano and green peppercorns on the nose.

Soft raspberry fruit seems loaded with oak-derived flavors. Toast, vanilla, bare wood, even a streak of cola come through. The wine drinks far more mature than the recent vintage, so drink up.\n101825\tUS\tBlock 10\t89\t49\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tWinter's Hill 2015 Block 10 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)\tPinot Noir\tWinter's Hill\tLT_90_Points\tPure Pommard, this has more concentration and forward fruit than the other single-block wines in this series. A pleasing mix of strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavors, along with a dash of flat seltzer, it carries through clean and refreshing to a moderately long finish with a hint of herb.\n60323\tUS\tWatershed\t86\t16\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tWinter's Hill 2015 Watershed Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills)\tPinot Gris\tWinter's Hill\tLT_90_Points\tOne of a trio of Pinot Gris offered in this vintage, this has a yeasty beery character. It falls into a generic white wine style, refreshing enough for a warm day's glug, with that yeasty tang reminiscent of a good cold brew. There is not much in the way of varietal expression though, just a bit of apple and pear fruit coming up in the finish.\n103957\tUS\tDelfino Vineyard\t87\t28\tOregon\tUmpqua Valley\tSouthern Oregon\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tSeufert 2014 Delfino Vineyard Dolcetto (Umpqua Valley)\tDolcetto\tSeufert\tLT_90_Points\tSpicy cherry aromatics carry a touch of tack room leather. Those flavors follow, leading into drying tannins with a dash of dark chocolate. The wine seems a little confused about where it's heading, but it packs plenty of flavor at the moment.

Not for the meek at 15.6% alcohol, it finishes a tad sweet.\n93832\tUS\tNo Oak\t87\t19\tCalifornia\tEdna Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tTolosa 2008 No Oak Chardonnay (Edna Valley)\tChardonnay\tTolosa\tLT_90_Points\tWith no oak, there's nothing but bright, searing acidity and pure, intense flavors of limes and kiwis in this dry Chardonnay.

Cedar, clove, sawdust and cranberry provide an elegant austerity of classic components, accented by a fragrance of violets. It gets better in the glass.\n96864\tUS\t\t91\t65\tCalifornia\tDiamond Mountain District\tNapa\t\t\tWallis Family Estate 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tWallis Family Estate\tGT_90_Points\tTough and hard, this is a Cabernet that tastes old fashioned with its dry, tannic astringency. It certainly marches to a different beat, even for the Diamond Mountain District that's known for difficult tannins. Will it age? There's a solid core of black currant and green olive flavor that suggests it will. Hold until 2018, at least.\n129056\tUS\tClos Rogue Valley Reserve\t93\t50\tOregon\tRogue Valley\tSouthern Oregon\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tLeah Jørgensen Cellars 2013 Clos Rogue Valley Reserve Cabernet Franc (Rogue Valley)\tCabernet Franc\tLeah Jørgensen Cellars\tGT_90_Points\tThough Leah Jørgensen models all of her wines on Loire Valley icons, this wine is more flower and fruit-powered than anchored in rock and herb. Ripe and complex, it's a cherries jubilee wine with amazing depth and Amaro-like details of bitters, cloves and macerated fruit.\n87827\tUS\tKick Ranch\t88\t21\tCalifornia\tSonoma County\tSonoma\t\t\tCarica 2010 Kick Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)\tSauvignon Blanc\tCarica\tLT_90_Points\tA very nice Sauvignon, easy to drink, and showing lots of style and elegance.

An intriguing blend of 43% Merlot, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Petit Verdot and 17% Malbec, it offers high-toned aromas, with notes of toasty spice and herb in front of raspberry and cherry. Supple and well balanced, the fruit flavors show poise and length.\n116663\tUS\tReserve\t87\t35\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C.

It's not offering much, but there is a big heart of blackberries and dark, ripe cherries, leading to speculations about ageability. Since this is Petite Sirah, it's likely to gradually soften and mellow for at least ten years.\n49332\tUS\tMaximus\t94\t35\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tBennett Lane 2008 Maximus Red (Napa Valley)\tRed Blend\tBennett Lane\tGT_90_Points\tThis is one of the best red wines at this price in California. A Bordeaux blend with a splash of Syrah, it's so rich and opulent, it just dazzles from start to finish. Floods the mouth with sweet cherries, raspberries, milk chocolate and red licorice, yet gets structure from firm tannins and bracing acidity. Lives up to its name, a Cabernet-based wine to feast on with your favorite foods.\n124127\tUS\tLewis Vineyard\t91\t30\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tJanuik 2005 Lewis Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))\tSyrah\tJanuik\tGT_90_Points\tThis has the sharp, spicy excellence of the best Washington Syrahs; it's got precision, depth and texture. The fruit flavors are compact, buttressed with earthy flavors that include iron and mineral and herb. There is a leafy edge to the tannins suggestive of tobacco. It's a complex and fascinating wine that should age well.\n34641\tUS\tLester Family Vineyards\t94\t46\tCalifornia\tSanta Cruz Mountains\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tWoodenhead 2012 Lester Family Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)\tPinot Noir\tWoodenhead\tGT_90_Points\tIncredibly inviting aromas of boysenberry-blackberry pie, deep red raspberry, anise and tobacco greet the nose. This wine is soft on the palate, with cherry and berry fruit that give way to layer upon layer of black sage, licorice, espresso, mocha dust and dark chocolate chips.\n83853\tUS\tPennacchio Vineyard\t96\t45\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tDe Loach 2009 Pennacchio Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tDe Loach\tGT_90_Points\tWith the 2009 vintage, De Loach is at the top of its Pinot Noir game, and this one, from a chilly vineyard south of Sebastopol, is among its best ever. The crisp acidity, like a squirt of lime, that accompanies the raspberry, cherry and persimmon fruit is bracing. Meanwhile, a mushroomy earthiness gives complex layers that don't stop. It should age through the next decade.\n123268\tUS\tHeritage\t85\t30\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\t\t\tSan Antonio 2007 Heritage Red (Paso Robles)\tRed Blend\tSan Antonio\tLT_90_Points\tThis Rhône-style blend smells and tastes a little hot.

In other words, classic Foothills Zin. But just as important is what it's not. It's not high in alcohol, nor is it sweet. Drink this balanced Zin with barbecued ribs.\n32322\tUS\tStone Tree Vineyard Reserve\t91\t35\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tColumbia Crest 2007 Stone Tree Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))\tCabernet Sauvignon\tColumbia Crest\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine surprises by being so very pretty—unexpected from such a hot site. Lovely scents of raspberry, strawberry, mint and spice lift the nose; the palate is medium-bodied, nicely tart, perfectly balanced and long. The mix of sweet and tart red fruits lasts deliciously, with the spice adding grace notes. Though blended and aged in 100% new French oak barrels, the oak is muted, and the fruit shines through.\n69438\tUS\tGabriel Archer Reserve\t87\t36\tVirginia\tVirginia\t\t\t\tThe Williamsburg Winery 2009 Gabriel Archer Reserve Red (Virginia)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tThe Williamsburg Winery\tLT_90_Points\tA blend of 44% Petit Verdot, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Malbec, 12% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc, this is dressed with brown spices, tart cherries, dried rose petals and char aromas.

Lean and refined, it shares a generosity of chocolate on the palate, with a slight spiciness to the finish.\n115064\tUS\tDry\t91\t22\tNew York\tNorth Fork of Long Island\tLong Island\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tPaumanok 2014 Dry Riesling (North Fork of Long Island)\tRiesling\tPaumanok\tGT_90_Points\tJuicy mango and yellow peach flavors are intensified by a mineral slick in this gorgeously textured wine. A jolt of lime on the midpalate gives edge to silky layers of fruit, exposing a lingering honeycomb finish. Complex yet light bodied and quaffable, it's a new benchmark for Long Island Riesling.\n123860\tUS\tCharles Vineyard\t89\t28\tCalifornia\tAnderson Valley\t\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tFoursight 2013 Charles Vineyard Semillon (Anderson Valley)\tSémillon\tFoursight\tLT_90_Points\tThis dry white wine seems to be all about smooth texture and reserved flavors rather than overt fruitiness. It has a gold, Chardonnay-like color, mild aromas of almond and butter, a rather full body and a lingering but subtle honey-like finish.\n26989\tUS\t\t87\t30\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\t\t\tSchug 2012 Chardonnay (Carneros)\tChardonnay\tSchug\tLT_90_Points\tThis Chardonnay isn't as oaky as the winery's more expensive estate bottling. Its barrel notes don't overwhelm the wine, allowing bright citrus, tropical fruit and peach flavors to show through. The palate is accented with brisk acidity.\n129633\tUS\tAmbassador's\t90\t30\tCalifornia\tArroyo Grande Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tOrfila 2012 Ambassador's Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley)\tChardonnay\tOrfila\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine shows the acidity of its cool Central Coast appellation, with ripe, long hang-time flavors of tropical fruit, apricot and peach, along with plenty of toasty oak notes. You'll want to drink this wine with rich fare, like complex scallop and shrimp dishes.\n83044\tUS\t\t89\t45\tCalifornia\tSanta Cruz Mountains\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tLeft Bend 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tLeft Bend\tLT_90_Points\tOn this dense, appealing and fruit-driven bottling from Camel Hill Vineyard, fresh-pressed blackberry meets with touches of other red fruits, from dark strawberry to plum, enhanced by cocoa dust. Leather, dark chocolate, red cherry and blackberry flavors show on the palate, where incredibly sticky tannins still need a bit more time to smooth out.\n94360\tUS\tElerding Vineyard\t85\t28\tWashington\tHorse Heaven Hills\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tStottle 2009 Elerding Vineyard Malbec (Horse Heaven Hills)\tMalbec\tStottle\tLT_90_Points\tThis is quite a change from the winery's previous vintage, with the alcohol reaching a hefty 15% and the new oak aging now at 50% new for 21 months. The result is astringent and earthy, a little sweaty and leathery, with drying tannins.\n53519\tUS\t\t89\t20\tCalifornia\tLivermore Valley\tCentral Coast\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tDarcie Kent Vineyards 2014 Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)\tChardonnay\tDarcie Kent Vineyards\tLT_90_Points\tThis ripe, all-fruit wine tastes unoaked because a lush blend of apple, peach and pear crowds the aromas, and more of the same fruitiness expands in the flavors. The mouthfeel is especially gentle, and the finish almost sweet.\n121139\tUS\tPinot For Paws\t83\t14\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tOne Hope 2011 Pinot For Paws Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)\tPinot Noir\tOne Hope\tLT_90_Points\tWith a pale color and a light, silky mouthfeel, this Pinot feels fine in the mouth.

The acidity is still pronounced, and suggests that further aging is a good idea. A nice dusting of cinnamon adds interest to the finish.\n124955\tUS\t\t89\t9\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\t\t\tRedwood Creek 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (California)\tSauvignon Blanc\tRedwood Creek\tLT_90_Points\tDefines a certain style of Sauvignon Blanc, namely the bone-dry, ultracrisp version whose firm structure frames a bright, zesty taste. The flavors are of lemons, limes, grapefruits, figs, white pepper and minerals, with a rich grassiness. This Loire-like wine is so versatile, you can have it with almost anything.\n38565\tUS\tLia's Vineyard\t87\t25\tOregon\tChehalem Mountains\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tDaedalus Cellars 2006 Lia's Vineyard Chardonnay (Chehalem Mountains)\tChardonnay\tDaedalus Cellars\tLT_90_Points\tThis is the first Chardonnay for Daedalus Cellars. Flavors are rich and full-bodied, with candied orange peel, sweet citrus and vanilla most noticeable among them. Left on the lees for almost 18 months, this is wide open and ready to drink.\n120148\tUS\t\t91\t45\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tStarfield 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Merlot\tStarfield\tGT_90_Points\tThis juicy, minerally blend is composed of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Merlot. The winery aims to source from cool vineyard sites and this bottling is true to that in style—elegant and balanced, subtle in tannins and aged in only 50% new oak. Bay leaf and mint come to the fore ahead of clove.\n128848\tUS\tOlivet Grange Vineyard Estate\t92\t68\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tInman Family 2012 Olivet Grange Vineyard Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tInman Family\tGT_90_Points\tA candied caramel aroma subtly lifts from the bouquet of this wine, nearly overtaken by fresh-cut rose. Earthy and full of forested characteristics, it's smooth and lush, with a spicy cinnamon finish and restrained oak. It's ready to enjoy, the use of more than 50% whole-cluster in the fermentation adding an exotic, tangy element.\n95058\tUS\tEssence\t95\t45\tOregon\tRibbon Ridge\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tBrick House 2013 Essence Chardonnay (Ribbon Ridge)\tChardonnay\tBrick House\tGT_90_Points\tOne large (500 liter) barrel was set aside with wine from a single acre of four interplanted and ungrafted Chardonnay clones. This is truly a natural wine, fermented with no additives, aged on the lees for 18 months, and bottled unfined and unfiltered. Deeply rich flavors of apple pastry, buttery barrel and sweet spice are ineffably long and seductive. This rare and exceptional wine should be consumed in its youth.\n121820\tUS\tJolie Bouche\t92\t44\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tEfeste 2014 Jolie Bouche Syrah (Yakima Valley)\tSyrah\tEfeste\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine is tight as a drum at present. Brooding aromas of iron, black cherry, pomegranate, bacon fat, spice and cured meat lead to concentrated full superpolished dark-fruit flavors.

The palate is dense, with black cherry, blackberry and black plum fruit layered across roasted-pork flavors.\n39446\tUS\tDutton Ranch - Fox Den Vineyard\t93\t58\tCalifornia\tGreen Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tDutton-Goldfield 2009 Dutton Ranch - Fox Den Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley)\tPinot Noir\tDutton-Goldfield\tGT_90_Points\tShows the elegantly crisp, almost austere structure of the winery's 2009s, courtesy of the cool vintage. Tight at first in acids and tannins, as it warms it gives off deep layers of sour cherries, cola, pomegranates and rhubarbs, all of them dry, earthy fruits that sing of the soil. Should develop bottle complexity through 2015.\n31582\tUS\tRenegade Margarita Vineyard\t90\t24\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tAncient Peaks 2012 Renegade Margarita Vineyard Red (Paso Robles)\tRed Blend\tAncient Peaks\tGT_90_Points\tCooked cherries in vanilla butter, just-pressed espresso, chopped dill and a hint of tar decorate the nose of this 71% Syrah, 24% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot blend from a unique vineyard atop the Cuesta Grade. Black licorice, dark blackberries, rustic elderberries and a cedar-y, asphalt-laden grip power the palate.\n103587\tUS\t\t88\t28\tNew York\tNorth Fork of Long Island\tLong Island\tAnna Lee C.

And then there are the big-time tannins that are so large a part of Petite Sirah's personality.\n61500\tUS\tTwo Vines\t85\t8\tWashington\tWashington\tWashington Other\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tColumbia Crest 2007 Two Vines Chardonnay (Washington)\tChardonnay\tColumbia Crest\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a perfect go-to, everyday Chardonnay, solid and light, if a bit unexciting. The fruit flavors of apple and melon are gentle and soft, and the oak treatment delicately handled. You get a little bit of buttered popcorn, but it's not a night out at the movies.\n20034\tUS\tChileno Valley Vineyards\t86\t30\tCalifornia\tMarin County\tNorth Coast\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tDutton-Goldfield 2014 Chileno Valley Vineyards Riesling (Marin County)\tRiesling\tDutton-Goldfield\tLT_90_Points\tHere is a friendly, fruity, medium-bodied wine with light apple and pear aromas. Off-dry flavors are more melony and floral, and the wine has a relatively soft texture. Made from old vines and fermented in stainless steel, it offers subtle charms.\n67454\tUS\tOriginal Vines\t94\t41\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tThe Eyrie Vineyards 2014 Original Vines Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills)\tPinot Gris\tThe Eyrie Vineyards\tGT_90_Points\tPlanted in 1965, these are the oldest examples of this variety in the entire country. Splendid texture is a defining characteristic, with a yeasty, creamy mouthfeel. Ripe apples and toasted grains come through, as the wine extends through a long and powerful finish. Try it with grilled shrimp and a wine and butter sauce.\n16857\tUS\t\t93\t22\tCalifornia\tSierra Foothills\tSierra Foothills\t\t\tTerre Rouge 1999 Syrah (Sierra Foothills)\tSyrah\tTerre Rouge\tGT_90_Points\tWhat an interesting wine. It drinks like it really comes from someplace, which is to say, it has terroir. It smells earthy and peppery, with a perfume of cassis. It's soft in tannins and acids, but utterly delicious. Hard to exaggerate the lip-smacking quality and fantastic finish.\n3384\tUS\tMemorista Tradition\t92\t25\tOregon\tEola-Amity Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tOvum 2015 Memorista Tradition Riesling (Eola-Amity Hills)\tRiesling\tOvum\tGT_90_Points\tFrom a different block of the same vineyard as the “Whale label” Memorista, this is drinking much better at the moment.

This small-scale producer does a fine job. Its Shea designate is a captivating wine loaded with blueberry, blue plum, black raspberry and a touch of violets. One-third new French oak brings a vein of chocolate. The balance is impeccable. Drink this with enjoyment immediately, or cellar it through 2025.\n87603\tUS\tBlock 28\t90\t35\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tHendry 2010 Block 28 Zinfandel (Napa Valley)\tZinfandel\tHendry\tGT_90_Points\tEasy and gentle in mouthfeel, this has soft, velvety tannins, but the flavors are big and complex. It offers waves of blackberry and blueberry jam, anisette liqueur, milk chocolate, bacon and white pepper as well as a smoky, creamy touch that melts into a long, spicy finish. It's high in alcohol, but wears it well.\n107914\tUS\tMatthew's Station Vineyard\t90\t30\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tJoseph Swan Vineyards 2013 Matthew's Station Vineyard Tannat (Russian River Valley)\tTannat\tJoseph Swan Vineyards\tGT_90_Points\tFresh fruit aromas, dominated by black cherry, expand on the substantial palate. This wine is a rich, robust and ripely built expression of a dark-horse grape in these parts. Black licorice dots a jammy concentration of fruit and of the rich texture, rewarding those who like their wines powerfully packed.\n93109\tUS\tThomas Road\t90\t85\tCalifornia\tGreen Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tIron Horse 2012 Thomas Road Pinot Noir (Green Valley)\tPinot Noir\tIron Horse\tGT_90_Points\tFrom a vineyard block planted in 1990, this wine is distinguished by an earthy forest-floor characteristic, along with smoky oak and bacon, especially on the entry.

The 2010 delivers the usual richness, with vast, deep fruit, mineral, oak and leesy flavors. It's as full bodied as a red wine, but a little heavy for a Chardonnay. Not an ager, it's best enjoyed now with the richest Chardonnay-friendly dishes.\n124386\tUS\tEstate Vineyard\t90\t34\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\t\t\tGundlach Bundschu 2009 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)\tPinot Noir\tGundlach Bundschu\tGT_90_Points\tRipe fruit and new oak combine for lush, complex flavors in this dramatic young Pinot Noir.

As in 2006, the cuvée includes a splash of Petit Verdot. From the extraordinary 2007 vintage, this wine has it all: depth, polish and panache. The richly fruity nose brings on the berries and cherries; they fill the palate and add layers of fig, plum, chocolate and coconut.\n54824\tUS\tWoodsLake Due Anni Red\t87\t16\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tPatterson NV WoodsLake Due Anni Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\tRed Blend\tPatterson\tLT_90_Points\tHigh-toned, with somewhat muted fruit – waxy comes to mind – yet with appealing softness and immediate drinkability.

It's made largely from grapes off the Rutherford estate, and contains one-quarter Sémillon. Oak does not play a significant role, although the lees do.

The tannins are fine-grained but quite noticeable, especially for a white wine.\n90814\tUS\tClos de Betz\t94\t48\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tBetz Family 2008 Clos de Betz Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tBetz Family\tGT_90_Points\tTight and precise, with sharply defined edges, this needs hours of breathing time. Dense black fruit, pretty herbal grace notes, supple, slightly grainy tannins. Built for the long term.\n69204\tUS\tCluster Select Late Harvest\t93\t29\tCalifornia\tAnderson Valley\t\t\t\tNavarro 2007 Cluster Select Late Harvest Riesling (Anderson Valley)\tRiesling\tNavarro\tGT_90_Points\tThis bottling is usually among the more opulent, successful white dessert wines in California, and the '07 certainly fits that bill. With 20.1% residual sugar, it's fantastically sweet, yet has enough fruity stuffing, balanced by high acidity, to satisfy. The pineapple, apricot and orange flavors could be somewhat more intense but it's certainly a very delicious dessert wine.\n99341\tUS\tCarter Vineyard\t94\t63\tOregon\tEola-Amity Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tKen Wright 2014 Carter Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)\tPinot Noir\tKen Wright\tGT_90_Points\tThe defining characteristic of Carter seems to be a taste of steel or gun metal running through the spine. It's here again, with compact fruit and drying tannins. That fruit has a dark core, and it's polished and textural, with lightly herbal highlights. This is a wine to track in the cellar over the next decade or longer.\n2453\tUS\tThe Geologist\t90\t50\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tThurston Wolfe 2010 The Geologist Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tThurston Wolfe\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine is a blend of Upland Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Double Canyon Petit Verdot (38%) and McKinley Springs Malbec. It's aromatically reserved, revealing fresh and dried herbs, green pepper, vanilla, cocoa and dark cherry. The dark fruit flavors show a very pretty combination of richness and restraint.\n86778\tUS\tCardinal\t92\t90\tCalifornia\tAdelaida District\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tThe Farm Winery 2012 Cardinal Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaida District)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tThe Farm Winery\tGT_90_Points\tFrom a winery and region where big and chewy reign, this is a rather approachable and pretty take on the grape, with woody aromas of blackberry, elderberry, black gravel and plum skins. The palate shows blueberry and Concord grape fruit as well as licorice shavings and dried herbs. The structure is strong but smooth, so it's serious but easy to put down with a smile.\n107868\tUS\tEl Pomar Estate\t93\t125\tCalifornia\tEl Pomar District\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tSextant 2013 El Pomar Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (El Pomar District)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tSextant\tGT_90_Points\tDeep-dark chocolate, concentrated boysenberry, black pepper and purple flowers make for an inviting and lavish nose on this bottling, one of the top in each vintage from this winery. Silky, soft yet firm tannins frame the sip, where flavors of black cherry, boysenberry and black raspberry are woven through leather and dried meats.\n115157\tUS\t\t91\t25\tCalifornia\tDry Creek Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tDry Creek Vineyard 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tDry Creek Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine over-delivers a mouthful of juicy quality vis-a-vis price, combining Cab with smaller dabs of Petit Verdot, Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Savory blackberry and cassis lift the fruitiness, seasoned in savory tones of black tea and cranberry that give it an edge. Fleshy and smooth, it's a good wine to stock up on.\n59994\tUS\tRodgers Creek Vineyard\t95\t75\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tRamey 2013 Rodgers Creek Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Coast)\tSyrah\tRamey\tGT_90_Points\tA perennial standout, this Syrah is cofermented with 10% Viognier, all fruit sourced from a site on the western edge of Sonoma Mountain in the cool confines of the Petaluma Gap.

Aromatic wood flavors of pipe smoke and cigar box show on the palate, along with red cherry fruit, vanilla and sagebrush elements.\n73091\tUS\t\t87\t18\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tNaches Heights 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))\tSyrah\tNaches Heights\tLT_90_Points\tFrom a very high altitude vineyard, this solidly built Syrah is soft and saturated with dark fruits. It has an earthy base and a broad midpalate, that lasts well but could use just a bit more focus. This is the first Syrah from this young vineyard, and it's definitely headed in the right direction.\n53293\tUS\tNocturne\t88\t32\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tMidnight 2012 Nocturne Syrah (Paso Robles)\tSyrah\tMidnight\tLT_90_Points\tPure purple fruit and flower aromas hit the nose on this straight-ahead bottling, with plum candy, sour cherry and a touch of soy sauce as well.

Dark and rich, the estate-grown fruit offers far more flavor than almost any domestic Merlot in this price range. Blackberries, black cherry, smoke and espresso lead into a grainy, chocolaty, tannic finish.\n27388\tUS\tFaith\t86\t38\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\t\t\tAver Family Vineyards 2010 Faith Red (California)\tRed Blend\tAver Family Vineyards\tLT_90_Points\tThis blend of Petite Sirah and Syrah is soft, rich and heavy.

The barrel flavors add fat and caramel over the top, but remain unintegrated and seem out of place. The wine reverts to its green side as the tannins take over.\n88814\tUS\t\t88\t28\tCalifornia\tSanta Barbara County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tFess Parker 2013 Viognier (Santa Barbara County)\tViognier\tFess Parker\tLT_90_Points\tA touch of vanilla, butter and seared lemons characterize the nose of this wine that also shows pears and apples, making it a solid Chardonnay alternative.

Fascinating aromas of game, animal hide and tar meet with black currant and elderberry on the nose. There is a strong density and tannic frame to the palate, where flavors of bay leaf, thyme and pepper spice up the undercurrent of elderberry and black plum skins.\n70250\tUS\tChalk Line Red\t90\t35\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tGuardian 2006 Chalk Line Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\tRed Blend\tGuardian\tGT_90_Points\tA picture-perfect mix of fruit, acid, stone and tannin.

Right now, it's tannic and astringent, with youthful flavors of blackberries, minerals and smoky new oak.

It's so soft and velvety, so rich in chocolate, blackberry and smoky oak flavors, that you can't resist sip after sip. It really defines the modern Napa style. The blend is Tempranillo, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, and the grapes were grown on the winery's estate vineyard in the heart of Atlas Peak.\n112194\tUS\t\t88\t26\tNew York\tNorth Fork of Long Island\tLong Island\tAnna Lee C.

Recently bottled, the wine may merit a higher score with a bit more bottle age.\n31916\tUS\t\t84\t75\tCalifornia\tOakville\tNapa\t\t\tMatthew Daniel 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tMatthew Daniel\tLT_90_Points\tToo ripe for balance or longevity, the blackberry and currant flavors in this Cab veer into raisins, with a bitter finish. It's also soft and very oaky, more like a warm, interior valley wine than one from this fine appellation. Drink now.\n16781\tUS\tTwo Messengers\t89\t30\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tMaison L'Envoyé 2012 Two Messengers Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)\tPinot Noir\tMaison L'Envoyé\tLT_90_Points\tA forward, softly fruity wine closer to California Pinot than most Oregon examples. The vintage contributes lush fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry, while aging in 20% new French oak brings a layer of smooth milk chocolate.\n111072\tUS\tJam's Blend\t87\t11\tCalifornia\tLodi\tCentral Valley\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tTortoise Creek 2010 Jam's Blend Chardonnay (Lodi)\tChardonnay\tTortoise Creek\tLT_90_Points\tA nicely done wine, especially at the price. It's very pretty aromatically, boasting pear and vanilla notes, full in the mouth and lemony with minerality. “Jam” of Jam's Blend is a commingling of the names of the two Tortoise Creek founders, Janie and Mel Master, who source the grapes for this wine out of a Lodi Rules vineyard.\n54787\tUS\tCupiens Videre Lucem\t92\t60\tCalifornia\tMount Veeder\tNapa\t\t\tCrosby Roamann 2010 Cupiens Videre Lucem Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCrosby Roamann\tGT_90_Points\tShows the hallmarks of a fine Mount Veeder Cabernet, namely immediate succulence, intensely concentrated mountain fruit, and yet an almost certain capacity to age. Lush, ripe flavors of blackberries and crème de cassis lead to a long, soft finish.

Big, juicy, rich and round, it piles on the fruit flavors—apples, pears, white peaches and lemons. All are balanced against each other and the supporting, natural acidity, finished with a frame of new-oak toast. Drink 2016 to 2028.\n58787\tUS\tFewel Family Estates Vineyard\t91\t40\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tCultura 2011 Fewel Family Estates Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley)\tCabernet Franc\tCultura\tGT_90_Points\tAged 28 months in French oak, this wine shows the coffee highlights and lightly earthy character of the variety, in a wine with just-right ripeness, a balanced structure and some legitimate depth. It would be no surprise if it aged well through 2024 or longer.\n123479\tUS\tMcClellan Estate Vineyard\t91\t30\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tSeven Hills 2007 McClellan Estate Vineyard Petit Verdot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))\tPetit Verdot\tSeven Hills\tGT_90_Points\tThe grape's floral component plays against its dense and inky tannins, making this a complete and relatively soft version of pure Petit Verdot. It fills in the usual midpalate hole with juicy fruit and softened tannins. It glides—not a word usually found with this as a varietal—into a silky, fruity, sweetly floral finish.\n2605\tUS\tBell Mountain Vineyard\t90\t52\tCalifornia\tAlexander Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tMedlock Ames 2008 Bell Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tMedlock Ames\tGT_90_Points\tThis Cab wants a few more years to let its internal inconsistencies resolve. The primary cherry and blackberry fruit has faded and is turning nutty. But it's still pretty tannic. Needs to throw some sediment to let the inherent fruit emerge. Try after 2016.\n57979\tUS\tRedwood Road Estate\t90\t25\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tArmida 2016 Redwood Road Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tArmida\tGT_90_Points\tWith 20% Pinot Gris in the mix and a percentage of French oak-aging, this white is thirst-quenching and medium bodied, expressive in grassy pea shoots and apricot.

An herbal underbrush hints at an elegant backbone, despite the huge force of power and weight. It finishes in a flourish of lavender and black licorice.\n102558\tUS\t\t86\t25\tWashington\tHorse Heaven Hills\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tCanoe Ridge 2005 Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills)\tSyrah\tCanoe Ridge\tLT_90_Points\tA little floral/grapey scent comes up from the glass, then the wine descends into darker, grippier, more tannic levels with boysenberries and smoke. There's lots of acid—maybe too much—and it gives a sense of something missing as the wine heads into the finish. Green, earthy, chewy tannins leave a slightly harsh impression.\n36858\tUS\t\t86\t12\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tCastle Rock 2009 Pinot Noir (Columbia Valley (WA))\tPinot Noir\tCastle Rock\tLT_90_Points\tNo it's not a mistake—this is Columbia Valley Washington Pinot Noir.

Earthy, tannic, even a bit rough, but showing genuine varietal character and enough tart red fruit to provide a counterpoint.\n59317\tUS\tFar Away Vineyard\t89\t26\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tTrio Vintners 2010 Far Away Vineyard Mourvèdre (Yakima Valley)\tMourvèdre\tTrio Vintners\tLT_90_Points\tSourced again from the excellent Far Away vineyard, this pure varietal Mourvèdre shows lovely, fruit-driven aromas of baked cherry, plum and apple.

This blend of 58% Pinot Noir and 48% Chardonnay boasts an aggressive bead that gives it a brash, in-your-face quality ideal for casual summer sipping, less so for elegant, formal occasions.\n11245\tUS\tPinot Dry\t88\t15\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C.

There is a noticeable tannic structure to the sip, where red-cherry and rose-petal flavors are quite mellow, refreshing and very quaffable. Time may add more complexity, but it's fun and lively now.\n69729\tUS\tTierra Alta Vineyard\t89\t42\tCalifornia\tBallard Canyon\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tComartin 2013 Tierra Alta Vineyard Syrah (Ballard Canyon)\tSyrah\tComartin\tLT_90_Points\tSuave blueberry-chocolate notes meet with light and delicate violet florality on the nose of this single vineyard bottling from the Bay Area-based producer.

The nose displays some volatile aromas, which carry onto the palate. Depending upon your particular sensitivity, this may or may not enhance the experience.\n63932\tUS\tGhielmetti Vineyard\t88\t26\tCalifornia\tLivermore Valley\tCentral Coast\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tFenestra 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Livermore Valley)\tCabernet Franc\tFenestra\tLT_90_Points\tSoft, round and leathery tannins give way to plum, cherry, cranberry and sage in this subtly rendered Cab Franc out of one of the Livermore Valley's most vaulted vineyards, an approachable version of California Cab Franc that's moderate in price and alcohol (13.9%).\n76724\tUS\tLafond Vineyard\t89\t28\tCalifornia\tSta.

The mouthfeel is thick and the flavors juicy, with tangy cranberry and raspberry mixing with richer plum. The tannins are soft.\n88361\tUS\tLarson Vineyard\t90\t38\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\t\t\tCarol Shelton 2011 Larson Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)\tPinot Noir\tCarol Shelton\tGT_90_Points\tThis is made in a lower alcohol, more elegant style, drier and leaner than some other Pinots, but perhaps more food-friendly and ageable as a result. It shows cherry, cola and herb flavors, richly oaked and balanced with acidity. Try cellaring it for 5–6 years.\n27198\tUS\t\t90\t17\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tBearboat 2008 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)\tChardonnay\tBearboat\tGT_90_Points\tMade in a Chablis style, this Chardonnay is bone dry and crisp in acidity. The pineapple and peach flavors are integrated with stony minerals. It's not a complex wine, but is super-clean and zesty, a nice complement to shellfish, mushroom risotto or a perfectly roasted chicken.\n8195\tUS\t\t91\t36\tCalifornia\tSanta Lucia Highlands\tCentral Coast\t\t\tCinnabar 2007 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)\tPinot Noir\tCinnabar\tGT_90_Points\tHere's a big, bold Pinot Noir that's almost like a Grenache in its full-bodied juiciness. It's very bright and ripe in black and red cherry, raspberry, milk chocolate and toffee flavors, with interesting spicy nuances of anise, cinnamon and pepper. Now through 2011.\n45638\tUS\t\t91\t20\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tFreemark Abbey 2007 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)\tChardonnay\tFreemark Abbey\tGT_90_Points\tA first-rate Chardonnay reminiscent of a fine French Chablis. Ultra-dry and steely, with mouthwatering acidity framing flavors of Meyer lemon, lime, lychee and minerals. Oak is there, in the background, providing hints of butter and toast.\n26550\tUS\t\t92\t25\tCalifornia\tLodi\tCentral Valley\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tKlinker Brick 2013 Petite Sirah (Lodi)\tPetite Sirah\tKlinker Brick\tGT_90_Points\tBig, robust and powerful, this inky wine has wonderfully complex and assertive flavors, along with a thick, velvety and tannic texture. Flavors of espresso, dark chocolate and blueberries rush across the palate, linger in the chewy texture and last on the long finish. A bit bold to fully enjoy now, this will be best after 2019.\n20337\tUS\t\t91\t45\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tKnudsen 2015 Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)\tChardonnay\tKnudsen\tGT_90_Points\tConsistent with past releases, this estate-grown effort includes Dijon 76 and 95 clonal material, planted in 1995. It's toasty in both nose and taste, with a tight core of green-berry, apple and banana fruit. As it breathes open there's a dollop of cream, just enough to smooth out the finish.\n7789\tUS\tEstate Grown Late Harvest\t92\t35\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tGordon Estate 2012 Estate Grown Late Harvest Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA))\tGewürztraminer\tGordon Estate\tGT_90_Points\tLight golden brown in color, this richly aromatic wine offers notes of brown sugar, dried pineapple, papaya and lychee. A whopping 270.8g/L residual sugar, it's thick, honeyed and sugary sweet with cinnamon, honey and granulated brown sugar flavors that linger on the finish.\n4340\tUS\t\t90\t19\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tSokol Blosser 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)\tPinot Gris\tSokol Blosser\tGT_90_Points\tFrom the warmest vintage on record, ripeness was never the issue here. It's balance and freshness that are the litmus test, and this passes with flying colors. Firm polished apple and pear fruit anchors the wine, with highlights of citrus skin. It's got all you could ask for in an all-purpose, solid and tasty young white wine.\n35032\tUS\tThe Doctor\t92\t60\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tKrupp Brothers 2007 The Doctor Red (Napa Valley)\tRed Blend\tKrupp Brothers\tGT_90_Points\tAn ambitious blend of Merlot, Tempranillo, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, grown mainly on Atlas Peak. It's bone dry and locked down in tannins and acidity, offering little relief, but there's a potent core of blackberries and black currants that yearns to bust through. Clearly well grown, it could be an ager, but predictions are risky.\n111537\tUS\t\t85\t30\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tMartin Ray 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tMartin Ray\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine is tasty with flavors of raspberries, cherries, cocoa, roasted almonds, cinnamon and sandalwood, but there's also a candied note that makes it a bit simple.

Once sipped, the soft, savory yet amply fruited palate shows plum, fig and mulberry that are seasoned with pencil shavings, graphite, incense and sandalwood.\n90023\tUS\tBella Luce\t87\t13\tCalifornia\tSonoma County\tSonoma\t\t\tFerrari-Carano 2012 Bella Luce White (Sonoma County)\tWhite Blend\tFerrari-Carano\tLT_90_Points\tThis is great bargain for a white wine this stylish and tasty. A blend of five varieties, it's rich and ripe with flavors of tangerine, stonefruit, lime, vanilla, cream and honey, accented with crisp acidity. They all come together into a seamless, easy-drinking and slightly sweet sipper.\n92606\tUS\t\t86\t14\tCalifornia\tSonoma County\tSonoma\t\t\tKenwood 2009 Zinfandel (Sonoma County)\tZinfandel\tKenwood\tLT_90_Points\tLots of fresh flavors of summer berry, red currant, tobacco and spice are found in this smoothly tannic Zin. There's a sweetness to the fruit, but the wine is actually dry. It's a fine Zinfandel to drink with barbecue. It should be relatively easy to find, with production nearing 21,000 cases.\n67840\tUS\tWine Bush Vineyard 60% / Steinbeck Vineyard 40%\t88\t26\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\t\t\tEberle 2009 Wine Bush Vineyard 60% / Steinbeck Vineyard 40% Zinfandel (Paso Robles)\tZinfandel\tEberle\tLT_90_Points\tMade in a softer, gentler style, almost with the body of a Pinot Noir. But the flavors are intensely concentrated, suggesting blackberries, black currants, cola, mocha and pepper. It's an easy Zin to drink now.\n126074\tUS\tE&E Shaw Vineyard\t88\t37\tWashington\tRed Mountain\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tTapteil Vineyard 2010 E&E Shaw Vineyard Red (Red Mountain)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tTapteil Vineyard\tLT_90_Points\tComprised of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend displays ripe, round, flavorful fruit, along with a leafy component. The barrel aging has added butterscotch and chocolate notes to the mix. The wine stops just a bit short, but further bottle age may help to lengthen the finish.\n14990\tUS\tDry\t88\t16\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tSilver Thread 2011 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)\tRiesling\tSilver Thread\tLT_90_Points\tRestrained, rather savory aromas of dill, fennel, apple and saline are some of the many nuances of this dry yet surprisingly supple Riesling.

That sounds worse than it is; taste this alongside a Bourgogne from a big shipper in a cool vintage and you wouldn't see much difference. The alcohol here is listed at just 12.5%. It's a serviceable everyday wine, but not priced accordingly.\n129194\tUS\tEstate\t84\t35\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tFoppiano 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tFoppiano\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine has an abundance of baked-plum flavor wrapped in smoky char.

It's loaded with flavor, just a little high-toned, and falls on the soft side for Washington dessert wines. But delicious?

The soft strawberry fruit flavors are wrapped in pleasing chocolate, and lightly spicy, toasty details pop up throughout. It just lacks grips and length.\n21303\tUS\tLos Trancos Creek Vineyard\t87\t38\tCalifornia\tSanta Clara Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tPortola Vineyards 2012 Los Trancos Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Clara Valley)\tPinot Noir\tPortola Vineyards\tLT_90_Points\tGrown along the Bay Area's Peninsula near the heart of Silicon Valley, this wine is brisk and energetic, with raspberry, pomegranate, dried ginger, sage, rose petals and lavender on the nose. Earthiness leads the slightly sour palate, with turned dirt, juniper and iron, finishing on a menthol sensation.\n105058\tUS\t\t87\t19\tWashington\tHorse Heaven Hills\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tMercer 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tMercer\tLT_90_Points\tBarrel aromas are in the lead, with notes of toast, café au lait, vanilla and caramel.

It will make a great pairing for robust, rich foods due to its medium body, lean mouthfeel and sturdy support from fine-grained tannins.\n84239\tUS\tBassi Ranch Vineyard\t94\t38\tCalifornia\tSan Luis Obispo County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tFlying Goat Cellars 2012 Bassi Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County)\tPinot Noir\tFlying Goat Cellars\tGT_90_Points\tCola, red cherry, thyme, green peppercorn, iron and chocolate hints show on the nose of this bottling from an extreme coastal property near Pismo. The palate is herbal in character, with thyme, sage, oregano and pine forest seasonings that overlay its bright cherry fruit. Already mature, there's tons of life left in this wine.\n69006\tUS\tShe-Devil\t91\t22\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tBergevin Lane 2008 She-Devil Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))\tSyrah\tBergevin Lane\tGT_90_Points\tThe best value among all of Bergevin Lane's 2008 Syrahs, this rich and smoky effort spent 20 months in oak.

It's dramatic for the layers of fruit, veering toward red berries, cherries and cocoa, and for the intense tannin structure. Feels vital and important and, above all, ageable. Give it a good six years in the cellar.\n118275\tUS\tQuaternarium\t93\t70\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

This is an all-purpose, affordable red blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Black cherry and olive, smoke and some noticeable alcohol (14.4% is credited) define a sturdy red in wide distribution.\n52567\tUS\t\t87\t22\tCalifornia\tMonterey County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tLe P'tit Paysan 2012 Petite Sirah (Monterey County)\tPetite Sirah\tLe P'tit Paysan\tLT_90_Points\tIan Brand's stab at this grape shows a lot of black rock minerality and bloody meats on the nose, layered across blueberry syrup and sour cherry elements. The palate is much lighter than other takes on this varietal, showing menthol-laced flavors of blackberries and tobacco.\n41069\tUS\tRosé of\t87\t18\tOregon\tRogue Valley\tSouthern Oregon\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tWeisinger 2013 Rosé of Syrah (Rogue Valley)\tSyrah\tWeisinger\tLT_90_Points\tA bright copper color, this is done in a French style, with an emphasis less on freshness than on more mature flavors. Impressions of rose water, cracker and orange liqueur contribute to the mix. This wine should be consumed now through 2016.\n15685\tUS\tDomaine Lois Louise\t92\t42\tCalifornia\tSanta Cruz Mountains\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tClos de la Tech 2009 Domaine Lois Louise Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)\tPinot Noir\tClos de la Tech\tGT_90_Points\tThe most affordable offering in the Clos de la Tech portfolio, it offers cinnamon and other baking spices plus caramel on the nose.

A wine made for the table, it'll pair well and widely, though it can also stand deliciously on its own.\n63412\tUS\tBrut Cuvée\t90\t45\tCalifornia\tSta.

Combining 64% Cabernet Sauvignon with 24% Cabernet Franc and 12% Petit Verdot from an estate-farmed vineyard, it's intense.\n112349\tUS\tSanta Catalina Island Vineyards\t92\t72\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tRusack 2014 Santa Catalina Island Vineyards Pinot Noir (California)\tPinot Noir\tRusack\tGT_90_Points\tThis ambitious project delivers another great wine with plenty of deliciousness to substantiate its crazy endeavor to plant grapes on a windswept island. Baked red plum, cola and cinnamon aromas lead into an acid-driven palate full of ripe yet tangy cranberry fruit and a strong sagebrush quality.\n11878\tUS\tDCV Estate Block 10\t90\t32\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tDry Creek Vineyard 2015 DCV Estate Block 10 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)\tChardonnay\tDry Creek Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a well-made wine from a specific site, seamless in full-bodied texture and sumptuous flavors of golden honey, baked apple and pear.

Blackberry tart, ripe blueberry, cassis, milk chocolate, licorice and sweet, smoky cedar flavors flood the mouth, dramatically huge and memorable, and lasting long into the finish. The tannins are obvious, but sweetly ripe and soft. A brilliant evocation of Napa Cabernet, despite a high production level of nearly 30,000 cases, which is about the same size as a Bordeaux first growth. Shows the class and potency this bottling has exhibited for many years, and believe it or not, the price is a relative bargain these days.

It is very fine, with keen acidity and a noble structure tinged with minerality. Give it 3–5 years to age.\n108680\tUS\tThe Unnamed Estate\t92\t65\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tReynvaan Family Vineyards 2012 The Unnamed Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))\tSyrah\tReynvaan Family Vineyards\tGT_90_Points\tThe color is light and the black and green olive, smoked meat and savory aromas are reserved.

The nose offers clean lines of wet cement, lemongrass, Gravenstein apple and a slightly exotic spice. Chilled Asian pear flavors kick off the sip, but then comes a buttery, macadamia nut warmth that's hedonistic and delicious.\n25457\tUS\tElevage Blanc\t88\t42\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tChimney Rock 2007 Elevage Blanc White (Napa Valley)\tWhite Blend\tChimney Rock\tLT_90_Points\tA white Bordeaux-style wine based on Sauvignon Blanc, it shows upfront citrusy flavors of pineapples and limes, enriched with the vanilla and smoke of oak.

The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.\n104793\tUS\t\t87\t9\tCalifornia\tLodi\tCentral Valley\t\t\tPeirano 1999 Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi)\tSauvignon Blanc\tPeirano\tLT_90_Points\tJust what the doctor ordered in a likeable, affordable white wine.

Extreme energy shows on the sizzling palate, where Key lime, lemongrass and lemon peels conspire for a light-but-sharp experience.\n112801\tUS\t\t94\t40\tWashington\tWashington\tWashington Other\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tBoudreaux Cellars 2005 Merlot (Washington)\tMerlot\tBoudreaux Cellars\tGT_90_Points\tWhether by virtue of vintage or bottle variation, Boudreaux wines seem to gyrate a bit wildly when first released. This new 2005 is no exception. At first sniff it explodes into life, the aromas a mix of herb, spice, tar, smoke, earth and fruit. Flavors are threaded together into a seamless, saturated whole—plum, cassis and cherry liqueur up front, earth and tannin right behind. Some tasters may find it leaning toward the medicinal, but for those who love Rob Newsom's full-speed-ahead style, this is a gorgeous bottle.\n117055\tUS\tLas Amigas Partners Vineyard\t93\t45\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tSleeping Giant 2013 Las Amigas Partners Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)\tChardonnay\tSleeping Giant\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a lovely white made by Chris Dearden. Whole-cluster pressed and fermented in once-used French oak, the grapes are sourced from a 12-acre parcel planted to Old Wente clone Chardonnay. Dark golden in hue, it has graceful acidity and a burst of lemon blossom on the nose that evolves into a sublime lightness and crispness on the palate.\n26529\tUS\tFellom Ranch\t93\t55\tCalifornia\tSanta Cruz Mountains\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tLeft Bend 2013 Fellom Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tLeft Bend\tGT_90_Points\tA classic Cab in the Santa Cruz Mountains style, this savory bottling shows black pepper, charcoal and grilled blueberries on the nose along with tons of dried herbs.

A clean, crisp core of tangy berry is framed in large, dry, somewhat chalky tannins, and finishes with a hit of chocolate.\n45384\tUS\tBrandlin Vineyard\t88\t38\tCalifornia\tMount Veeder\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tPeter Franus 2013 Brandlin Vineyard Zinfandel (Mount Veeder)\tZinfandel\tPeter Franus\tLT_90_Points\tBrambly berry and heaps of brown sugar combine for a thick, soft and richly layered wine that pushes the limits in terms of ripeness. It has small amounts of Mourvèdre, Charbono and Carignane blended throughout and was aged in one-third new French oak.\n49348\tUS\tEstate\t89\t40\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tJericho Canyon Vineyard 2013 Estate Rosé (Napa Valley)\tRosé\tJericho Canyon Vineyard\tLT_90_Points\tLight salmon-pink in color, this refreshing wine is made from a combination of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, which all provide structure and complexity. Subtle in aroma and flavor, it is light and tart, leaning toward intriguing flavors of pomegranate and cranberry.\n72524\tUS\tSaralee's Vineyard\t86\t38\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tDue Cani 2012 Saralee's Vineyard Marsanne-Roussanne (Russian River Valley)\tMarsanne-Roussanne\tDue Cani\tLT_90_Points\tThe acidity is strong and brisk on this Rhône-style blend, and the flavors are equally strong.

It's all in fine balance, full flavored, fruity and round. A mix of peaches, apricots and Mandarin oranges makes this an interesting Riesling with some complexity.\n60148\tUS\tReserve\t84\t45\tCalifornia\tLos Carneros\tNapa-Sonoma\t\t\tBennett Lane 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (Los Carneros)\tChardonnay\tBennett Lane\tLT_90_Points\tCrispness provides the balance needed for this Chardonnay.

In this case it has produced an interesting wine. It feels midway in weight between Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay. Unoaked with a medium-bodied mouthfeel, it's bright with citrus fruits, honey and a fleshiness that suggests pairing with veal scallopini or veal Marsala.\n12026\tUS\t\t92\t20\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tToquade 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tToquade\tGT_90_Points\tA beautiful and interesting Sauvignon Blanc that's as dry as anything out there, with no trade of unripeness.

With stone fruit and a hint of vanilla, this affordable white should also be fairly easy to find (almost 4,000 cases made) and a successful pairing with a range of lighter salads and seafood dishes.\n65910\tUS\t\t88\t21\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tThree Rivers 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))\tMerlot\tThree Rivers\tLT_90_Points\tCocoa, herb, raspberry, vanilla and spice aromas are out front on this wine.

This is the case here. Just on the edge of sour, the very tart grapey flavors seem overtaken by acidity, without compensating depth or complexity.\n37733\tUS\tBuoni Anni\t93\t36\tCalifornia\tSanta Ynez Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tCent'Anni 2011 Buoni Anni Sangiovese (Santa Ynez Valley)\tSangiovese\tCent'Anni\tGT_90_Points\tKudos to winemaker Doug Margerum for holding onto this extremely pleasing wine long enough for all the components to come together. Six years in, the aromas of cola, black cherry, rose petal, pepper dust and crushed gravel are still fresh and vibrant, while the palate remains upright due to structural tannins. Flavors of blackberry, raspberry and baking spice abound, making for an elegant wine.\n118743\tUS\t\t88\t30\tCalifornia\tSanta Barbara County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tRusack 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)\tPinot Noir\tRusack\tLT_90_Points\tThe winery's entry-level bottling, this offers turned earth, juniper, cola and ripe red cherries on the nose.

A mix of yellow apple and pink grapefruit flavors, along with some skin phenolics, power on through.

Dry in style but accented by notes of pink grapefruit and lychee, Magdalena's daintiness is kept in check with a bracing acidity and elegant white tea astringency.\n5115\tUS\tTaylor Family Vineyard\t92\t85\tCalifornia\tStags Leap District\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tBrilliant Mistake 2013 Taylor Family Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tBrilliant Mistake\tGT_90_Points\tThis is the inaugural vintage for this producer, a husband-and-wife team in partnership with winemaker Maayan Koschitzky, who also works with Philippe Melka. The vineyard-designate is lush and powerful, a full-bodied, tannic representative of an amazing growing year. Mint, black olive, blackberry and cigar highlight the sensual texture, enriched in dark chocolate.\n113493\tUS\t\t86\t26\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\t\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tHawks View 2011 Chardonnay\tChardonnay\tHawks View\tLT_90_Points\tThis is tight to the point of being shut down. Scents of skin phenolics suggest pear and apple fruit, but there's little flesh on these bones, and the wine stubbornly refuses to open up, even after several hours of breathing time.\n33726\tUS\tI\t81\t45\tCalifornia\tAmador County\tSierra Foothills\t\t\tSunfire 2003 I Red (Amador County)\tRed Blend\tSunfire\tLT_90_Points\tRough and harsh in texture, this is a rustic, tannic blend of Tempranillo and Grenache that has overripe, burnt raisin flavors.\n34463\tUS\tBlanc de Noirs\t87\t37\tCalifornia\tNapa-Mendocino-Sonoma-Marin\tNorth Coast\t\t\tSchramsberg 2005 Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma-Marin)\tSparkling Blend\tSchramsberg\tLT_90_Points\tMade from 90% Pinot Noir with the balance Chardonnay, this beautifully colored bubbly shows the integrity the house of Schramsberg brings to its sparkling wines.

Apple flesh and lime rind sizzles into the citrus-driven palate, where a touch of lemon verbena adds complexity to this straightforward and delicious wine.\n48337\tUS\tPicazo Vineyard\t90\t36\tCalifornia\tLivermore Valley\tCentral Coast\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tMcGrail 2009 Picazo Vineyard Merlot (Livermore Valley)\tMerlot\tMcGrail\tGT_90_Points\tThis tastes deep, ripe and yet very smooth and drinkable for its full body and firmly tannic texture.

It emphasizes the flavors that are lost in a hotter climate—pepper, herb, tart berry, and juicy acidity. With alcohol at 12.3%, this sets a new standard for domestic, Euro-style Syrah.\n107862\tUS\tSentience Estate Grown\t93\t55\tOregon\tApplegate Valley\tSouthern Oregon\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tCowhorn 2013 Sentience Estate Grown Syrah (Applegate Valley)\tSyrah\tCowhorn\tGT_90_Points\tThis opens with inviting aromas of wet hay, espresso grounds, peat moss and pipe tobacco. In the mouth the fruit kicks in—cassis and black cherry—with plenty of acid. The tobacco note rings clearly all through a long, satisfying finish. Fermented with native yeasts, 43% whole cluster, and aged for nine months in new French oak, it's a wine with a solid decade of life ahead.\n124626\tUS\tSignature\t86\t50\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

Iijima\t\tWagner 2008 Dry Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)\tGewürztraminer\tWagner\tLT_90_Points\tAlthough subdued both aromatically and on the palate, this refreshing, dry Gewürztraminer smells sweetly of waxy white florals and lemons with a hint of bruised apples. There's not a lot of concentration of flavor, but its fresh apple and lemon flavors are clean and brisk, ending with a pleasant grapefruit pith finish.\n36484\tUS\t\t95\t75\tCalifornia\tDiamond Mountain District\tNapa\t\t\tGirard 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tGirard\tGT_90_Points\tWhere Girard's estate Cab is beautiful now, their Diamond Mountain bottling is one for the cellar. Veteran winemaker Marco DiGiulio has applied his considerable experience, with classic results. The wine is marked by firm tannins that make it astringent and sticky. But underneath all that is an explosion of currant, plum, licorice, chocolate and spicy curry flavor that dazzles. Should easily age for a long time in a proper cellar. Production was a paltry 325 cases, and worth the search.\n81854\tUS\tH3 Les Chevaux Red Wine\t90\t15\tWashington\tHorse Heaven Hills\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tColumbia Crest 2007 H3 Les Chevaux Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills)\tRed Blend\tColumbia Crest\tGT_90_Points\tLes Chevaux blends 48% Merlot, 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 2% Syrah, yielding a wine that is smooth, supple, and complete.

Even though the tannins are thick, they're as soft as velvet. The structural integrity of this wine is pure Napa Valley and makes the wine particularly fine.\n67506\tUS\tBeespoke\t87\t38\tCalifornia\tSanta Ynez Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tJorian Hill 2007 Beespoke Red (Santa Ynez Valley)\tRhône-style Red Blend\tJorian Hill\tLT_90_Points\tThere's so much raspberry, cherry, cola, clove, cinnamon and pepper flavor in this wine, it's hard to know where to begin. It's also dry, with smoky, vanilla oak notes. Yet it lacks the vital structure a good Rhône blend wants in order to house all this richness. Drink now. Grenache-Syrah.\n45488\tUS\tEast End\t88\t17\tNew York\tNorth Fork of Long Island\tLong Island\tAnna Lee C.

It's not sweet, but it has a pleasant softness around the edges of the mouthfeel.\n46326\tUS\tWirtz Vineyard Edelzwicker\t88\t28\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tBig Table Farm 2014 Wirtz Vineyard Edelzwicker White (Willamette Valley)\tWhite Blend\tBig Table Farm\tLT_90_Points\tEdelzwicker is an Alsatian term meaning noble blend, and is applied to any blend of white wine grapes. Here, it is Gewurztraminer, Pinot Gris and Riesling, capturing the floral aromatics and lightly oily mouthfeel of the former, along with the citrus and pear flavors from the latter two components. All in all it's an aromatic, floral, broadly flavorful and distinctive white wine.\n46449\tUS\tDel Arroyo Vineyard\t89\t32\tCalifornia\tLivermore Valley\tCentral Coast\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tNottingham Cellars 2010 Del Arroyo Vineyard Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)\tChardonnay\tNottingham Cellars\tLT_90_Points\tOpens aromatically exhibiting lemon cheesecake, then delves into the rightful amount of apple and pear, finishing with a hearty helping of vanilla and caramel.

There is more going on than just fruit and oak, as the earthy-spicy tones meld with fine-grain tannins. This kept getting better hours after opening and should mature well through 2018.\n57458\tUS\tReserve Semi-Sweet\t90\t16\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C.

It's dry, full bodied and pretty massive in terms of mouthfeel, so this is not a delicate flower and is best enjoyed with heartier fare or after some time to open.\n16382\tUS\tThe McNab\t92\t55\tCalifornia\tMendocino\t\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tBonterra 2013 The McNab Red (Mendocino)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tBonterra\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a bold dry wine from one of Bonterra's biodynamically farmed vineyards, and it has plenty of tannin in the texture and an abundance of ripe black-cherry, wood smoke and baking spice flavors to fill out that firm frame. For all its power the wine is also polished and velvety enough to sip with pleasure. Best after 2020.\n11318\tUS\t\t93\t50\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tVolker Eisele Family Estate 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tVolker Eisele Family Estate\tGT_90_Points\tFrom an organically farmed estate vineyard in Chiles Valley operated by the same family for more than 40 years, this 87% Cabernet Sauvignon-13% Merlot has soul and structure, as well a stony minerality that compels. Menthol and tobacco weave between thick layers of dark cherry and plum, complemented on the palate by exotic cardamom and clove. This is one worth cellaring through 2022 or giving an hour or two to open.\n91347\tUS\t\t91\t55\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tFrank Family 2012 Zinfandel (Napa Valley)\tZinfandel\tFrank Family\tGT_90_Points\tA nicely structured wine with a sizable component of Petite Sirah and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers a density of oak and tannin on the entry, offset by a juicy backbone of blackberry and cherry.

A pretty plum shade, it's still showing youthful tart acidic flavors. Cranberry, strawberry, raspberry and a touch of apple are all here, with more of that tart astringency as it concludes. This should continue to improve through 2021.\n102341\tUS\t\t88\t15\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C.

Completely dry, with exquisite tannins, its blackberry, currant, red licorice and oak-inspired flavors are massive and classic. Hard to exaggerate how good this fine wine is.

This gorgeous wine will open up even more if held in bottle until 2017–2019.

It shows ripe fruit, dense tannin, and some dark, toasted-coffee notes. The forward fruit is appealing, but the wine falls off in the middle and finishes quickly.\n37780\tUS\t\t87\t24\tCalifornia\tSanta Ynez Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tJorian Hill 2007 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)\tSyrah\tJorian Hill\tLT_90_Points\tGood and dry, with very soft, refined tannins and complex flavors.

It's flamboyant in jammy cherry, boysenberry and cola flavors, while oak adds pronounced char and vanilla. It's the most expensive wine ever released by the winery, but tasty as it is, it's sweet and simple. Tasted four times.\n666\tUS\t\t90\t20\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

The palate offers well integrated flavors of boysenberry, lavender, woody elderberry, herb-crusted beef roast and a minty, purple flowers sensation that lingers into the finish.\n62148\tUS\t\t86\t14\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tKudos 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)\tPinot Gris\tKudos\tLT_90_Points\tRound and fruity, this opens with mildly sweet flavors of melon and pineapple.

Dry and very tannic, it's not an ager.\n96103\tUS\tLEHM\t87\t20\tWashington\tLake Chelan\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

The flavors become mellow and more complex as they echo on the finish.\n41415\tUS\tVista Verde Vineyard\t94\t58\tCalifornia\tSan Benito County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tWilliams Selyem 2013 Vista Verde Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Benito County)\tPinot Noir\tWilliams Selyem\tGT_90_Points\tThe famed winery comes a bit south to make this earthy, savory wine, with smoked sage, leather, forest floor, cherry and slate on the nose. The palate packs elegantly tart cranberry and pure flavors of sage-smoked wild cherry with the juicy elements of an herb-crusted pork tenderloin roast.\n83854\tUS\tFamily Reserve\t96\t135\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tVenge 2009 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tVenge\tGT_90_Points\tA massive wine, decadent and splendid, and a worthy followup to the near-perfect 2008. Densely packed in fruit, it explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, minerals and sweet, toasty new oak. That richness is lifted to brilliance by the tannic structure, which is world class. So deliciously approachable, it's drinkable now, but it should develop over the next 6–8 years. Beyond that, all bets are off, because this modern style of soft, relatively high-alcohol wines has yet to prove itself over the long haul.\n128640\tUS\tDamavian Les Collines Vineyard\t91\t45\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

This is complex, quite youthful and tightly woven. I think it will require some years to pull itself together, but the balance is here, in a medium-bodied style, showing some herb, some citrus and plenty of muscle.

The palate is full-bodied, round and boldly flavored, with notes of spice, potpourri, and sun-baked plum that linger on the finish.\n86001\tUS\tWest Rows Sangiacomo Vineyard\t88\t32\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\t\t\tSignaterra 2010 West Rows Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)\tChardonnay\tSignaterra\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine continues to be big, with bold fruit and notable oak and lees influence. It's as full bodied as a red wine, with flavors of apricot, orange, buttered toast and yeasty cream flavors. Drink up.\n65566\tUS\t\t85\t24\tCalifornia\tAlexander Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tWattle Creek 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tWattle Creek\tLT_90_Points\tThere's plenty to enjoy aromatically and texturally in this wine.

Medium in body, with a sense of grace, it has gentle flavors that are reminiscent of spiced cocoa and cherry.\n110858\tUS\t\t87\t25\tCalifornia\tRed Hills Lake County\t\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tVigilance 2011 Chardonnay (Red Hills Lake County)\tChardonnay\tVigilance\tLT_90_Points\tFull and fleshy, with a tropical edge, this is creamy in its vanilla and almond paste flavors.

Iijima\t\tWagner 2012 Ice Riesling (Finger Lakes)\tRiesling\tWagner\tLT_90_Points\tBright lemon, tangerine and white-floral notes are countered by whiffs of spice and earth on this robust, yet structured, ice wine. The mouthfeel is rich and lush, but brightened by clean, focused acidity and a hint of bitter grape tannin on the finish.\n16276\tUS\t\t86\t22\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tWar Horse 2011 Red (Napa Valley)\tRed Blend\tWar Horse\tLT_90_Points\tAn intensely powerful combination of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and Zinfandel, this was given more than two years mulling things over in French oak. A menthol streak runs through the otherwise blackberry and leathery, tannic layers of this wine, the finish a tad short.\n15407\tUS\t\t85\t30\tIdaho\t\t\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tWilliamson Vineyard 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon\tCabernet Sauvignon\tWilliamson Vineyard\tLT_90_Points\tThe vanilla, cocoa and dark-fruit aromas show some volatility.

If you just judge by price, you'll be amazed how complex and layered it is.\n8772\tUS\t\t89\t18\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tHazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2012 Grüner Veltliner (Finger Lakes)\tGrüner Veltliner\tHazlitt 1852 Vineyards\tLT_90_Points\tGrüner Veltliner is fairly new to the Finger Lakes, but Hazlitt's exemplifies the grape variety's promise in the region. Touched with honeycomb and lemon on the nose, it's ripe and rich on the palate with concentrated flavors of white peach, melon and apricot. Bright with acidity, it finishes long with hints of green herb and lime.\n88041\tUS\t\t85\t20\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tNewlan 1998 Merlot (Napa Valley)\tMerlot\tNewlan\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose seems lean and vaguely unripe. You get aromas of chocolate and green olives, and the most distant whiff of meat. Of course there's a great deal of oak, including American, which lends vanillin and smoky notes, but still an impression of leanness carries through in the mouth. It struggles to say the word “fruit.” It's also very tannic. That aside, it may soften and improve in time.\n119420\tUS\tRollat\t86\t38\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

No residual sugar was listed, but in terms of flavor, it's hard to ignore. If you like that richness, there is a creamy, milk-and-honey flavor, along with toasty notes.\n123151\tUS\t\t87\t17\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tLake Sonoma 2009 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)\tChardonnay\tLake Sonoma\tLT_90_Points\tA nice Chardonnay that shows ripe pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, with added smoky richness from oak, and the finish is dry and crisp.

A tad decadent, it settles down nicely in the glass.\n62825\tUS\tEstate Grown\t87\t42\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tGrgich Hills 2008 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley)\tMerlot\tGrgich Hills\tLT_90_Points\tGive this wine credit for dryness, crisp acidity and intensity. It's rich and strong in sour black cherry candy, cola, bitter dark chocolate and herb flavors. It's also very tannic, so much so that it's practically undrinkable now. Give it 4–5 years in the bottle, decant, and drink with beef or lamb.\n28564\tUS\t\t80\t18\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tElizabeth Rose 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tElizabeth Rose\tLT_90_Points\tToo powerful in feline and gooseberry aromas and flavors, this dry, tart in-your-face Sauvignon Blanc just isn't ripe enough to recommend.\n31793\tUS\t4B\t87\t17\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tSean Minor 2006 4B Merlot (Napa Valley)\tMerlot\tSean Minor\tLT_90_Points\tRich is the word for this Merlot. It flatters the palate with jammy black cherries, red currants, anise, cocoa and violets, accented with sweet, smoky oak. Turns a bit one-dimensional, but offers plenty of flavor.\n58434\tUS\t\t87\t30\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tFiresteed 2007 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)\tPinot Noir\tFiresteed\tLT_90_Points\tThough two years older than the widely available Oregon bottling from Firesteed, this wine is almost its twin.

Given time in half new oak, it takes on flavors of apple and vanilla, never venturing out of range and remaining balanced and textured.\n5139\tUS\t\t92\t50\tCalifornia\tSonoma Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tGundlach Bundschu 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tGundlach Bundschu\tGT_90_Points\tThe producer sources primarily from its historic Rhinefarm Estate Vineyard for this wine, a rich expression of the variety opaque in color. Meat, black pepper, leather and tobacco give it a velvety lushness and concentration buoyed by complex, savory components. The lengthy finish is all about bittersweet chocolate.\n15640\tUS\tUntamed\t92\t48\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tSparkman 2010 Untamed Syrah (Yakima Valley)\tSyrah\tSparkman\tGT_90_Points\tHere is a dark, smoky, meaty Syrah, smooth in the mouth and showing plenty of black cherry fruit. The silkiness plays nicely against flavors that are dark with olive, espresso and cacao, and highlighted with hints of orange peel and pepper.\n67045\tUS\tEstate Bottled\t87\t20\tVirginia\tMonticello\t\tAlexander Peartree\t\tTrump 2014 Estate Bottled Meritage (Monticello)\tMeritage\tTrump\tLT_90_Points\tWith all five of the Bordeaux red grapes in this blend, this shows a good concentration of dark bramble and spice on the nose. Medium-bodied in feel, with grippy tannins, dark shades of currant and plum meet a zippy core of granite on the palate. Specks of tarragon and black pepper mark the finish.\n88135\tUS\t\t90\t35\tCalifornia\tAlexander Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tThe Calling 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tThe Calling\tGT_90_Points\tThis straightforward wine shows an exuberance of toasted oak and grip at first before relaxing into its more mannered self, a twist of cedar and sage giving it a classic sensibility. Cassis and black cherry take on more power on the full-bodied palate, exhibiting the soft approachability of the appellation.\n113927\tUS\t\t94\t70\tCalifornia\tStags Leap District\tNapa\t\t\tClos du Val 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tClos du Val\tGT_90_Points\tClos du Val has gone as far as they intend to in order to make a ripe, opulent Cab in the modern Napa cult style. But they remain faithful to their Bordeaux-inspired house style, which is leaner and more tannic than most. The result is a natural cellar candidate, with an official alcohol of only 13.5%. Rich in blackberries and black currants, this wine should easily develop over the next 10–15 years.\n77075\tUS\t\t93\t48\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tStony Hill 2014 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)\tChardonnay\tStony Hill\tGT_90_Points\tThis producer is well respected for its long reputation of making ageworthy whites and this vintage is no exception, a bright, complex and nutty expression of pear and ginger cookie. Textured and restrained, it shows a wealth of structure and lemony acidity. Cellar it away until 2024 if you can.\n69099\tUS\tLate Harvest Lot 1\t85\t24\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tBloomer Creek 2008 Late Harvest Lot 1 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)\tGewürztraminer\tBloomer Creek\tLT_90_Points\tThere's a dark, caramelized flair to the honeyed, off-dry palate on this amber gold Gewürz. Rich and full bodied in style, its slightly tinned lychee flavors, black tea astringency and spicy finish make for an unusual, contemplative wine.\n1982\tUS\tRichland Reserve\t88\t22\tVirginia\tVirginia\t\t\t\tPotomac Point 2010 Richland Reserve Chardonnay (Virginia)\tChardonnay\tPotomac Point\tLT_90_Points\tThis smells deep and bass-like, with resonating notes of honeyed white currant, spiced breakfast toast and apricot preserves, accented with touches of caramel and toasted nut. It feels round, rich and opulent, with a nice lift of acids that give the wine some spring.\n60439\tUS\t\t86\t17\tCalifornia\tNorth Coast\tNorth Coast\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tWilliam Hill Estate 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast)\tSauvignon Blanc\tWilliam Hill Estate\tLT_90_Points\tWell-rounded, this offers aromas of fresh-cut grass and citrus fruit, citrusy flavors, good acidity, a smooth texture and soft finish.

Michelle/Antinori collaboration on Red Mountain. A fine bottle for the price, it shows the same elegance and supple texture as the frontline wine. Black cherry, blueberry, mocha and smoke swirl over and around the palate. Only in the finish does it seem to fade quickly, with a very slight suggestion of glue in the aftertaste.\n85624\tUS\t\t92\t35\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tAubichon Cellars 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)\tPinot Noir\tAubichon Cellars\tGT_90_Points\tRich round cherry fruit, lightly infused with tobacco highlights, introduces this delicious wine. There is a pleasing softness to the palate, without it being in any way flat or flabby. The fruit seems more mature than the young vintage would suggest, and it's drinking more like a wine from half a decade ago, which means you don't need to cellar it to get cellar-style flavors. Pie cherry, orange peel and even a touch of pineapple peeks through the lingering finish.\n55124\tUS\tArcturos\t85\t29\tMichigan\tMichigan\t\tAlexander Peartree\t\tBlack Star Farms 2012 Arcturos Cabernet Franc (Michigan)\tCabernet Franc\tBlack Star Farms\tLT_90_Points\tBramble patch aromas evoke the entire bush: from stems to berries.

The acids are still a little awkward, but time should help with that. Otherwise, it's got a lot of power and grace, with classic, tangy Washington berry flavors and pleasing hints of earth and leaf in the finish.\n127026\tUS\tThe Expedition Canoe Ridge Estate Vineyard\t84\t16\tWashington\tHorse Heaven Hills\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tCanoe Ridge 2012 The Expedition Canoe Ridge Estate Vineyard Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills)\tMerlot\tCanoe Ridge\tLT_90_Points\tThough Syrah makes up only 14% of this wine, it seems to take over the show with its notes of plum and smoke playing against barrel accents of pencil lead and vanilla. It drinks off dry (9.5g/L residual sugar), with dry grainy tannins.\n52099\tUS\t\t89\t14\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tWillamette Valley Vineyards 2014 Riesling (Willamette Valley)\tRiesling\tWillamette Valley Vineyards\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a medium-sweet Riesling boasting Spätlese-level alcohol, that mixes soft fruit flavors of apple, peach and pear with hints of honey and tea.

It's a very straightforward sipper, not hugely complex, but refreshing and bright with slight nectarine flavors and lush pear.\n120289\tUS\tLot #7\t84\t15\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\t\t\tTangley Oaks 2010 Lot #7 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)\tChardonnay\tTangley Oaks\tLT_90_Points\tGets the Chardonnay job done effectively, offering flavors of orange, papaya, buttered toast, caramel, cream and vanilla honey.

The acidity is keen and the finish is long, with vanilla and butter notes. It's aged in 40% new French oak, and it has the roundness to show for it.\n79417\tUS\tFeliz Vineyard\t89\t14\tCalifornia\tMendocino\t\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tBrutocao 2012 Feliz Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino)\tSauvignon Blanc\tBrutocao\tLT_90_Points\tAn exceptionally priced Sauvignon Blanc from estate-grown fruit, Brutocao's Feliz Vineyard offers pronounced aromatics, all honeysuckle and apricot.

The palate shows raw beef, sour plum and crushed thyme flavors.\n47740\tUS\tAnnie Dyer\t87\t50\tCalifornia\tSta. Rita Hills\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tLincourt 2012 Annie Dyer Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)\tPinot Noir\tLincourt\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine, which is named after vintner Bill Foley's grandma, is quite light in the glass, and shows a lot of florals on the nose, along with strawberry syrup and brown spice. It's a little flat on the palate, yet suggests fresh raspberries and rose petals, proving a nice light and bright sipper that wouldn't overwhelm a fish dish.\n100723\tUS\tLodi Native Maley's Lucas Rd Vineyard\t89\t35\tCalifornia\tMokelumne River\tCentral Valley\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tMacchia 2014 Lodi Native Maley's Lucas Rd Vineyard Zinfandel (Mokelumne River)\tZinfandel\tMacchia\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine has a spicy allure, with seemingly more oak influence than most of the Lodi Native wines. Attractive nutmeg and cinnamon aromas lead to even more spicy flavors that are backed with moderate fruit flavors and some good tannic grip in the texture.\n53068\tUS\tFlying Colors\t89\t29\tWashington\tRed Mountain\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tGenoa 2011 Flying Colors Red (Red Mountain)\tRed Blend\tGenoa\tLT_90_Points\tLabeled a “Super Tuscan-Style Blend” this is 36% Syrah, 45% Sangiovese and 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, all from Red Mountain vineyards. It opens gracefully with pretty raspberry and cherry fruit, then grounds itself in a base of mineral and earth, enlivened with natural acidity.\n15710\tUS\tNo Oak\t88\t19\tCalifornia\tCentral Coast\tCentral Coast\t\t\tTolosa 2010 No Oak Chardonnay (Central Coast)\tChardonnay\tTolosa\tLT_90_Points\tThis really gets the tastebuds whistling, with brisk acidity that brightens the lemon, lime and orange flavors. Even though it's rich in honey flavor, it finishes dry.\n65930\tUS\tPatricia's Cuvée\t89\t55\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tDobbes Family Estate 2013 Patricia's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)\tPinot Noir\tDobbes Family Estate\tLT_90_Points\tWarm, roasted aromas beckon and engage your interest, while in the mouth, the wine puts a tart citrus frame around blue-plum and black-cherry fruit. Streaks of cola, earth and coffee bring further highlights.\n98246\tUS\tDead Nuts\t88\t24\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tChronic Cellars 2015 Dead Nuts Zinfandel (Paso Robles)\tZinfandel\tChronic Cellars\tLT_90_Points\tThis Zinfandel-based wine, which blends 13% Tempranillo and 6% Petite Sirah, shows strawberry, cherry, baking spice and cola aromas. There is decent tannic tension on the palate, and the flavors—sarsaparilla, cola, stewed plum and clove spice—are easily enjoyable.\n99356\tUS\tMeritage Quintessential\t87\t48\tCalifornia\tNorth Coast\tNorth Coast\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tSuncé Vineyard & Winery 2007 Meritage Quintessential Meritage (North Coast)\tMeritage\tSuncé Vineyard & Winery\tLT_90_Points\tThis blend of all five Bordeaux varieties has cranberry, plum, sage and herb throughout and is good, with a medium-body and tart finish. Aged almost two years in nearly all new French oak it's fairly light on its feet. Much of the blend (27%) is Alexander Valley Cabernet, the Merlot is from Sonoma Valley and the Cab Franc from Dry Creek. The Malbec and Petit Verdot, earthy and leathery both, come from Clear Lake.\n54542\tUS\tStolpman Vineyard\t88\t25\tCalifornia\tSanta Ynez Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tSanta Barbara Winery 2009 Stolpman Vineyard Sangiovese (Santa Ynez Valley)\tSangiovese\tSanta Barbara Winery\tLT_90_Points\tOne of the better examples of Sangiovese out there, in a difficult field. You have to credit the fine vineyard iocated in the emerging Ballard Canyon section of the valley. The acidity is brisk, as it tends to be in this variety, and the finish is thoroughly dry, with flavors of cherries and tobacco. Try as a lighter alternative to Zinfandel.\n30362\tUS\tHerzog Vineyard\t88\t20\tCalifornia\tClarksburg\tCentral Valley\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tAndis 2014 Herzog Vineyard Chenin Blanc (Clarksburg)\tChenin Blanc\tAndis\tLT_90_Points\tThis tart, lean wine from an Amador County winery is very dry, very tangy and very herbaceous in aroma and flavor. It will be a great choice at lunch or before dinner for people who appreciate aromatic expression and an austere texture.\n111668\tUS\tThe Archimage\t92\t52\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tSleight of Hand 2012 The Archimage Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tSleight of Hand\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine blends near-equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a smidgen of Cabernet Sauvignon (3%) rounding it out. It pulls no punches with sweet, opulent aromas and flavors of dried herbs, coffee, licorice and cherry—an unabashed crowed pleaser.\n115916\tUS\t\t85\t40\tOregon\tRogue Valley\tSouthern Oregon\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tGriffin Creek 2012 Tempranillo (Rogue Valley)\tTempranillo\tGriffin Creek\tLT_90_Points\tTart and tight, this mixes chalky, citrus-inflected acids with light fruit flavors of wild berries. There's a palate-drying minerality, and the sharp acids and ultradry tannins are tough to punch through.\n77473\tUS\t\t87\t18\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\t\t\tGloria Ferrer 2010 Chardonnay (Carneros)\tChardonnay\tGloria Ferrer\tLT_90_Points\tButtered toast, orange jam, vanilla, honey and yeasty flavors swirl together to make this easy-drinking Chardonnay.

Along the way it tells a tale of citrus tanginess and sculptured minerality, finishing with the slightest backbone of textured tannin.\n70904\tUS\tBien Nacido Vineyard Entropy\t90\t55\tCalifornia\tSanta Maria Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tDrake 2008 Bien Nacido Vineyard Entropy Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)\tPinot Noir\tDrake\tGT_90_Points\tShows the ripe fruit and bright acidity this famous vineyard is known for. Savory in raspberry jam and smoky, caramelized oak, with a fresh, clean mouthfeel. A very nice Pinot Noir to drink now.\n49752\tUS\t\t88\t36\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tFlying Dreams 2012 Garnacha (Columbia Valley (WA))\tGarnacha\tFlying Dreams\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of overripe red apple, cranberry, raspberry and white pepper predominate, along with light oxidative notes. The jammy red fruit and apple flavors are luscious and sweet, bringing a pleasing sense of texture along with a lingering finish.\n28341\tUS\tLes Collines Vineyard\t89\t39\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tCollege Cellars 2014 Les Collines Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCollege Cellars\tLT_90_Points\tComing from a site best known for its Syrah, this wine brings high-toned aromas of violets, herb and dark fruit. The black-fruit flavors are rich yet supple, with fine-grained but occasionally toothy tannins providing support. Mocha flavors linger on the finish. It's a bit oak heavy but by and large carries it.\n33087\tUS\t\t88\t24\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tRiché NV Red (Paso Robles)\tRed Blend\tRiché\tLT_90_Points\tElegant black currant, clove and leather appear on the nose of this well-priced blend from a San Diego-based winery founded by millennial marketing wiz Dylan Steeves. Dried black cherries and licorice show on the slightly leathery palate.\n125679\tUS\tDevils' Peak\t86\t54\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tTerlato 2011 Devils' Peak Red (Napa Valley)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tTerlato\tLT_90_Points\tA blend relying on 70% Cabernet Franc with the remainder an equal split of Malbec and Merlot, this offers a lot of raspberry tart and caramel, along with a tropical element of coconut. Softened tannins and mellow oak combine to good effect, before an abbreviated finish of vanilla.\n22621\tUS\t\t89\t36\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tCass 2014 Mourvèdre (Paso Robles)\tMourvèdre\tCass\tLT_90_Points\tThere's a slight bit of meaty funk, as can be expected from this grape, on the nose of this bottling, alongside red berries, graphite and a touch of herbs. The palate packs very dark, even black fruit along with a hint of marjoram-crusted roast beef, proving a tad sweet and quite acidic.\n20019\tUS\tYash-Vir\t86\t28\tVirginia\tVirginia\t\tAlexander Peartree\t\tNarmada 2010 Yash-Vir Red (Virginia)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tNarmada\tLT_90_Points\tOak notes persist on the nose and palate of this Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec blend. Heavy roast coffee, burnt toast and charred black-fruit flavors mark the full-bodied palate, while a zip of red currant acidity tries to shine through.\n29751\tUS\tHidden Block\t84\t65\tCalifornia\tDiamond Mountain District\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tMaterra Cunat Family Vineyards 2013 Hidden Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tMaterra Cunat Family Vineyards\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine offers earthy funkiness and simple coconut and red currant notes, its structure somewhat muted and one-dimensional.\n66858\tUS\t\t89\t21\tCalifornia\tHappy Canyon of Santa Barbara\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tPiocho 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)\tSauvignon Blanc\tPiocho\tLT_90_Points\tPetrol, sliced tennis ball and fresh-cut grass show on the nose of this bottling that is boosted in the suavity category by 13% Sémillon. It's immediately lively on the tongue, with soda and lime-pith energy giving tension to the Anjou pear skins and kumquat fruit.\n109534\tUS\tSebastiano Vineyard\t94\t45\tCalifornia\tSta. Rita Hills\tCentral Coast\t\t\tBonaccorsi 2010 Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)\tPinot Noir\tBonaccorsi\tGT_90_Points\tAstonishingly deep in flavor, offering an explosion of the ripest cherries and raspberries imaginable. Additional notes of toasty oak, brown sugar and cinnamon spice make this Pinot irresistible, while the acidity brings all the richness to life. Drink now–2016.\n104655\tUS\t2:2\t91\t78\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tTenor 2012 2:2 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tTenor\tGT_90_Points\tMostly Merlot (68%) and Cabernet Franc (26%) along with a smidgen of Cabernet, this wine brings aromas of toast, vanilla bean, red and black fruit and fresh herb. The palate is dense and full, with firm tannins providing the frame.\n60556\tUS\t\t88\t26\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tArgyle 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)\tPinot Noir\tArgyle\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a subtle and intriguing bottle, crafted from a range of sources, offered in significant quantities (16,300 cases) and showing varietal fruit, spice and a deft touch with the barrels. Not a big wine, but balanced and quite flavorful, with more depth than you expect at this price point. Lots of chocolate and spicy burnt coffee in the finish.\n95146\tUS\tCider Ridge Vineyard\t90\t38\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tBalletto 2013 Cider Ridge Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)\tChardonnay\tBalletto\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a lovely, lighthearted vineyard-designated wine. Soft, layered and decadent on the palate, it offers a mix of green apple, Meyer lemon, ginger and marshmallow. Intense on the finish in savory, briny fennel, it sees only 20% new oak and is structured enough to hang out in bottle a few years more.\n78885\tUS\tPuccioni Ranch\t90\t32\tCalifornia\tDry Creek Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tPuccioni 2014 Puccioni Ranch Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)\tPetite Sirah\tPuccioni\tGT_90_Points\tRaisin cake and dried cherry are highlighted in this fairly light expression of what can otherwise be a hearty variety, buoyed by a brightness of acidity. Vanilla and plum add to the mix, as soft, supple tannins support the weight and breadth of an approachable wine.\n35260\tUS\t\t82\t11\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tAlias 2013 Pinot Noir (California)\tPinot Noir\tAlias\tLT_90_Points\tA strong buttery, jammy aroma and flavors like cherry candy make an unusual profile and cover up most varietal flavors in the grapes.\n61213\tUS\tLone Oak Vineyard\t87\t50\tCalifornia\tSanta Lucia Highlands\tCentral Coast\t\t\tLucienne 2010 Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)\tPinot Noir\tLucienne\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine shows the richness of the vineyard, offering flashy flavors of raspberry and cherry jam, licorice, brown sugar and  smoky oak. Balanced with bright acidity, this is meant to be consumed now and over the next few years.\n40221\tUS\tGalleron Road Vineyard\t86\t20\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tNola 2007 Galleron Road Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tNola\tLT_90_Points\tAggressive in grass, hay, gooseberry and grapefruit flavors, this wine's dry, slightly vegetal quality is enriched with sweeter notes of lemon sorbet and vanilla. Notable for the acidity, which makes it exceptionally crisp and clean.\n113392\tUS\tEstate Reserve\t82\t48\tCalifornia\tSanta Cruz Mountains\tCentral Coast\t\t\tHeart O' The Mountain 2009 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)\tPinot Noir\tHeart O' The Mountain\tLT_90_Points\tThis is too ripe, with a disagreeable pruny taste. The wine is dry and full bodied, but is almost like a minor Port. The official alcohol reading is 14.8% by volume, but it tastes higher and hotter than that.\n101330\tUS\tForchini Vineyard North Flats\t87\t50\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tWilliams Selyem 2009 Forchini Vineyard North Flats Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)\tZinfandel\tWilliams Selyem\tLT_90_Points\tQuite a good Zinfandel, although it does show some of the weaknesses that strike this vineyard in a cool year. You'll find a smooth, full-bodied wine, with ample tannins and fine berry-cherry fruit and spices. Yet it's curiously ambiguous in the mouth, and the concentration falls apart midpalate.\n68585\tUS\tBradford Mountain Vineyard\t91\t32\tCalifornia\tDry Creek Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tPeterson 2005 Bradford Mountain Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)\tZinfandel\tPeterson\tGT_90_Points\tThis is an enormously fruity Zinfandel that offers a flood of flavor, making it instantly likeable. Dry, full-bodied and tannic, it's powerful in briary blackberries, cherries, currants, cola, anise, pepper and cinnamon, with an edge of sweet, smoky oak and cocoa. Should develop over the next 6–8 years.\n46892\tUS\tAliette\t94\t55\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\t\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tWillaKenzie Estate 2014 Aliette Pinot Noir\tPinot Noir\tWillaKenzie Estate\tGT_90_Points\tFrom the oldest part of the estate, planted in 1992, this excellent effort seems to have entered the phase where more aromatic complexity appears. It has lovely delineation of both scents and flavors, a matrix of fruit, soil and Pommard clone. Strong streaks of tobacco and chocolate annotate the core of raspberry puree. The concentration and length are impressive.\n44525\tUS\tHillview Vineyard\t91\t30\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tGroth 2013 Hillview Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley)\tChardonnay\tGroth\tGT_90_Points\tFrom a relatively cool hillside site within the Oak Knoll District, this wine dances in lemon and green apple, completely crisp atop a fuller-bodied style embraced in oak. Luxurious on the palate, it finishes with a bite of salty brine.\n109173\tUS\tAll-In Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard\t90\t60\tCalifornia\tEdna Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tNo Limit 2010 All-In Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Syrah (Edna Valley)\tSyrah\tNo Limit\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine shows roasted beef with blackberry crust, fresh-cracked black pepper and tarry asphalt on the nose. The asphalt and charred meat play strongly on the heavy-duty palate that also offers blackberry balsamic reduction. It's brawny and burly, perhaps too much so for the everyday drinker.\n86923\tUS\tReserve\t88\t35\tCalifornia\tDry Creek Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tDry Creek Vineyard 1998 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tDry Creek Vineyard\tLT_90_Points\tDefines what makes this appellation great for Cabernet, but also why it won't rival Napa anytime soon. Brilliantly ripe fruit, lovely balance, such a pretty taste of the earth and, in this case, expensive oak. But there's that extra something it aspires to and doesn't quite achieve. It has to do with complexity of tannins.\n108833\tUS\t\t87\t19\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tShaw 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes)\tSauvignon Blanc\tShaw\tLT_90_Points\tNotes of spring blossom and fresh herbs perfume the nose of this Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is markedly riper, almost ruddy with fleshy yellow peach flavors. Aged one year on the lees, it shows a uniquely textured, mouth-coating feel that lingers on the finish.\n61371\tUS\tOld Vine\t82\t24\tCalifornia\tCalaveras County\tSierra Foothills\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tMilliaire 2010 Old Vine Zinfandel (Calaveras County)\tZinfandel\tMilliaire\tLT_90_Points\tThe aromatics are faint on this wine, and the taste puckeringly tannic and raisiny with a strong taste of toffee on the finish.\n113015\tUS\tSemi-Dry\t86\t18\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tSilver Thread 2013 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)\tRiesling\tSilver Thread\tLT_90_Points\tSavory shades of dust and pressed apple contrast fresh lemon and blossom in this off-dry Riesling. It's starkly acidic, but plush tangerine and peach flavors round out the midpalate. Finishes moderately long on a earthy mineral note.\n45479\tUS\tHaiku Ranch\t88\t18\tCalifornia\tMendocino\t\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tPhilo Ridge 2014 Haiku Ranch Chardonnay (Mendocino)\tChardonnay\tPhilo Ridge\tLT_90_Points\tSubstantial and smooth, this full-bodied wine starts slowly with mild fruit and butter aromas, then turns up the volume on the palate with ripe pear, vanilla and nutmeg. It conveys a feeling of oak-aged richness although it was tank-fermented.\n61357\tUS\tTopolos Vineyard Mr. Beast\t83\t25\tCalifornia\tSonoma Mountain\tSonoma\t\t\tBarber 2012 Topolos Vineyard Mr. Beast Zinfandel (Sonoma Mountain)\tZinfandel\tBarber\tLT_90_Points\tThis bottling has had its problems over the years, and while Barber's '12 is their best effort to date, it's still troubled. The fruit is overripe, with raisin and prune notes and bitter raisin-skin tannins. Still, you can gulp it down with barbecue.\n33975\tUS\tDoerner Vyd\t86\t30\tOregon\tUmpqua Valley\tSouthern Oregon\t\t\tSecret House 1998 Doerner Vyd Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley)\tPinot Noir\tSecret House\tLT_90_Points\tLight and bright, a shade darker than a hearty Rhône rosé, this cherry- and strawberry-flavored pacer displays saddle leather and earth notes that provide interest and depth. Fairly high in acidity, and with brisk, lightly peppery tannins, this would be great with cheese or spicy hors d’oeuvres.\n81111\tUS\tThe Chard\t87\t15\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\t\t\tCosentino 2009 The Chard Chardonnay (California)\tChardonnay\tCosentino\tLT_90_Points\tGood price for a Chardonnay this rich and satisfying. It's oaky and ripe and flamboyant in orange and pineapple fruit, yet a brisk cut of acidity and minerality saves it from being too sweet.\n70362\tUS\tDundee Hills Select\t89\t45\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine \tTorii Mor 2014 Dundee Hills Select Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)\tPinot Noir\tTorii Mor\tLT_90_Points\tSix barrels—one each from six vineyards—comprise this cuvée.

Despite its age, this is still fresh and in balance due to good core acidity. Yeasty, lightly resiny flavors come with notes of briny citrus, while an oaky-tasting finish is steady due to the aforementioned acidity.

A solid wine with traditional Rioja character.\n94572\tSpain\tAlea Tempranillo\t85\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Griñon 2009 Alea Tempranillo  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tMarques de Griñon\tLT_90_Points\tRubber and leather aromas create a slightly mulchy bouquet. The palate is snappy and acidic, with earthy, leafy red-fruit flavors. Finishes dry with crisp acidity and a touch of oak-related vanilla. Standard fare.\n10669\tSpain\t\t84\t18\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDon Olegario 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tDon Olegario\tLT_90_Points\tThis smells stalky and past its prime, but it's not stinky or maderized. The palate is fleshy in feel and oily in sensation, with bitter citrus flavors and pithy notes. Neither vital nor fresh on the finish.\n84190\tSpain\tViña Real Crianza\t88\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCVNE 2004 Viña Real Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tCVNE\tLT_90_Points\tQuite ripe for a traditional crianza. The bouquet starts out on the stewy side but soon sheds its weight to reveal flavors of blackberry, black cherry and earth. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy due to the wine's mild oak and overall ripeness. Drink now through 2010.\n94695\tSpain\tPrestigio\t85\t27\tNorthern Spain\tCigales\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVal de Los Frailes 2004 Prestigio Tempranillo (Cigales)\tTempranillo\tVal de Los Frailes\tLT_90_Points\tStretched and woody on the nose, with not much fruit. It feels wide, grabby and tannic, with leathery, herbal berry flavors. Grabby on the finish, this is still quite tannic and a bit tough on the palate.\n118927\tSpain\tMonte Clavijo\t85\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCriadores de Rioja 2006 Monte Clavijo  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tCriadores de Rioja\tLT_90_Points\tAn ordinary but competent Rioja. The fruit is light but young and fresh; the palate touches on raspberry and plum. A bit of mineral and natural bitterness work the finish, and overall this is a no-complaints kind of $10 wine.\n118844\tSpain\tCrianza\t90\t32\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tProtos 2009 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tProtos\tGT_90_Points\tTraditional oak-based aromas of mint, dill, tobacco, vanilla and coconut sit on top of tarry black-fruit scents. In the mouth, this is a snappy, tight, structured wine with flavors of oak, coffee, licorice, spice and blackberry. It's stylish on the finish, with toasty, peppery flavors that linger for a good, long while.\n20147\tSpain\tBrut\t83\t11\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMas Fi NV Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMas Fi\tLT_90_Points\tFaint aromas suggest white gumdrop.

It feels grabby almost to the point of cloying, with heavily oaked flavors of roasted black fruit and milk chocolate. This is oak dominated, but full and chocolaty.\n48567\tSpain\tPrado Enea Gran Reserva\t93\t63\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuga 2001 Prado Enea Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tMuga\tGT_90_Points\tIt's not easy to find mature Rioja from a great winery and a great year. This is all that; it smells of tobacco, earth and dried fruits. The palate is lively and not dying, while the flavors of cherry, raisin and marzipan are spot on. Compact and long on the finish, indicating that it still has another 10–15 years in it.\n87125\tSpain\tAlabaster\t97\t227\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTeso La Monja 2012 Alabaster  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tTeso La Monja\tGT_90_Points\tGorgeous from head to toe, this saturated Toro heavyweight sets a new bar for this winery and the region as a whole. Ribald blackberry aromas are toasty and carry a strong note of crushed stones. Cassis, black plum and blackberry flavors are complex and inspired, while the finish tastes of chocolaty oak, blackened toast and a black-fruit potpourri supported by just the right amount of acidity. Drink from 2017–2030.\n85745\tSpain\t\t89\t25\tNorthern Spain\tGetariako Txakolina\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tZudugarai 2014 Hondarrabi Zuri (Getariako Txakolina)\tHondarrabi Zuri\tZudugarai\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of children's vitamins, corn stalk and white peach set up a lemony stony zesty palate with lemon and nectarine flavors. A stony crisp cleansing finish does the job while not faltering.\n80153\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t22\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca La Emperatriz 2010 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tFinca La Emperatriz\tLT_90_Points\tSpicy generic berry aromas come with an herbal component and a note of licorice root. This feels tight and compact, but not overly ripe. Berry fruit flavors are herbal and the slightest bit green, with a black-pepper note in front of a rubbery finish with clamping tannins.\n56115\tSpain\t\t89\t20\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPazo Pondal 2015 Godello (Bierzo)\tGodello\tPazo Pondal\tLT_90_Points\tThis Godello feels composed and solid.

A smooth mouthfeel is devoid of edginess, while friendly white peach, melon and apple flavors are round on the finish.\n2469\tSpain\tPremium Fino\t90\t16\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDelgado Zuleta NV Premium Fino Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tDelgado Zuleta\tGT_90_Points\tIntense, nutty, yeasty aromas are briny and a touch creamy. This has a tight, pure, round palate with salty nectarine, apricot and nut flavors. Walnut oil and white pepper notes grace a direct, lively finish.\n53855\tSpain\tColumna\t84\t17\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCompañia de Vinos del Atlántico 2013 Columna Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tCompañia de Vinos del Atlántico\tLT_90_Points\tBriny, pickled aromas come with hints of citrus and flower blossom. This fast-aging Albariño is melony in feel, but it lacks the variety's patented kick and acidity. As a result, peach and apricot flavors are fleshy and chunky.\n65402\tSpain\tSirsell\t91\t30\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCapafons-Ossó 2006 Sirsell Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tCapafons-Ossó\tGT_90_Points\tReedy, attractive, classy aromas of red fruits, tobacco and fine herbs are like a red carpet entering the gala. The mouth is structured and tannic but not hard or biting; flavors of red berry, plum and cherry lean towards sweet, while the finish is long, medicinal and on the money. Drink now through 2014.\n121657\tSpain\tCastillo de Gormaz Crianza\t87\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Gormaz 2004 Castillo de Gormaz Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tViña Gormaz\tLT_90_Points\tSpicy, bretty and leathery; this type of wine represents Ribera in a traditional, no-tricks light. Air only helps it show its best attributes, which revolve around meaty black fruit and herbal accents. It's chewy, sort of tannic and finishes with flavors of moss and jerky. Good for near-term consumption.\n57367\tSpain\t\t89\t20\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArtadi 2014 Garnacha (Navarra)\tGarnacha\tArtadi\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine's earthy cherry and plum aromas come with a hint of milk chocolate. The palate is edged with rubbery tannins, its savory, lightly salted plum flavors growing jammier and more fig-like as it breathes. A textbook fruit-forward Grenache.\n38617\tSpain\tCapitoso\t88\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAltanza 2007 Capitoso  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tAltanza\tLT_90_Points\tGood, pure, dark and teetering on powerful, with strong, rich black plum aromas. The mouth is staunch and balanced, with full dark fruit flavors of blackberry along with bitter chocolate. Solid and clean throughout. A winner in its price range.\n121961\tSpain\tViña del Olivo\t90\t130\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tContino 2008 Viña del Olivo  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tContino\tGT_90_Points\tBerry, rubber, exotic spice, earth and toast aromas work in harmony. This blend of Tempranillo and Graciano is packed with acidity, structured tannins, oak and red-fruit flavors of plum and raspberry. It's only on the finish where you get richer notes of prune and pastry. Drink through 2022.\n125747\tSpain\t\t88\t28\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPasolasmonjas 2008 Garnacha (Navarra)\tGarnacha\tPasolasmonjas\tLT_90_Points\tSavory and exotic on the nose, with blueberry and cardamom. The palate strikes hard with tannic clamp and reduction. Flavors run lemony and herbal, with star anise and cardamom mixing with berry fruit. Clacky and tight on the finish, but serious and complex. 350 cases made; drink now through 2012.\n26857\tSpain\tMarionette\t90\t18\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEgo Bodegas 2014 Marionette Red (Jumilla)\tRed Blend\tEgo Bodegas\tGT_90_Points\tRich berry and graham-cracker aromas announce a ripe, easygoing Monastrell-Syrah blend. Chewy and slightly sinewy in feel, this offers heaps of tasty but creamy oak and vanilla to go with spicy, herbal berry fruit. A creamy, thick finish is fitting for a warm-climate wine like this.\n60569\tSpain\tVolvoreta Probus\t88\t25\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNuntia Vini 2005 Volvoreta Probus  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tNuntia Vini\tLT_90_Points\tCrushed floral aromas, berry-infused tea and cherry candy aromas give this wine a sweet profile. The palate, however, is anything but. It pounds with toasty black fruit, licorice and fiery menthol. The feel is a bit tannic but not terribly harsh, so maybe another three to five years will serve it well.\n35486\tSpain\tEl Telar\t90\t78\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVinessens 2012 El Telar Monastrell (Alicante)\tMonastrell\tVinessens\tGT_90_Points\tHeady raisiny aromas smell sweet, savory and a bit like animal fur. This is pinching and hot on the palate, which shouldn't surprise at 15.5% abv. Savory roasted blackberry and baking-spice flavors end with peppery heat and hard tannins. Drink this sizzling varietal Monastrell through 2023.\n34409\tSpain\tKios Elite\t91\t27\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTikalo 2004 Kios Elite Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo\tTikalo\tGT_90_Points\tEarthy and rich Tempranillo with hints of fresh herbs, tomato, balsam wood and spice in addition to roasted plum on the bouquet. The palate is tannic and big but shows a ton of fruit and classy flavors of roasted berry, dark chocolate, licorice and dried spices. Heady on the finish and aggressive, but loaded with flavor, kick and quality. Drink now through 2014.\n30684\tSpain\t\t85\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Coto 2012 Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tEl Coto\tLT_90_Points\tYeasty, dusty aromas of apple and melon lead to a plump, almost flat feeling palate with generic flavors of peach, apple and melon. The finish has a soft, mealy, slightly creamy and flat feel along with modest flavors of white fruits.\n10192\tSpain\tReserva\t87\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFernández de Piérola 2004 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tFernández de Piérola\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with leathery aromas suggestive of animal hide along with a leafy element and nuttiness. Airing reveals a compact, medium-intensity palate with baked, roasted, fairly sweet berry flavors. Finishes sweet and mildly leafy.\n124022\tSpain\tPonsalet Jove\t83\t16\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDaniel Belda 2013 Ponsalet Jove Monastrell (Valencia)\tMonastrell\tDaniel Belda\tLT_90_Points\tThis Monastrell opens with resiny, lactic aromas and a strong note of rubber. It's big, blocky and chunky in feel, while the flavor profile revolves around briny plum and rubber.\n36708\tSpain\tSatinela Medium-Sweet\t84\t9\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Cáceres 2007 Satinela Medium-Sweet White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tMarqués de Cáceres\tLT_90_Points\tIf you catch this wine young and properly chilled, it isn't that bad. It's very sweet and sugary, with candied melon, mango and citrus flavors. Then it gets more tropical on the finish, with ending notes of banana and mango. On the verge of tasting fake but not quite.\n122076\tSpain\tLui Selection Crianza\t92\t24\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbelis Carthago 2012 Lui Selection Crianza  (Toro)\tTempranillo\tAbelis Carthago\tGT_90_Points\tFull, dark aromas of varied black fruits set up a rich, chewy palate that's stern but not too hard. Flavors of black fruits and oaky spice are meaty as a whole, while the finish is lush, round and only slightly gripping. This Toro amounts to a great value. Drink through 2020.\n111778\tSpain\tSelecció\t90\t60\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tClos Berenguer del Molar 2012 Selecció Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tClos Berenguer del Molar\tGT_90_Points\tA dense, baked, raisiny nose is ultra ripe but also a bit flabby and damp-smelling. A big, grabby mouth-filler, this offers baked, oaky flavors of blackberry, fig and chocolate, finishing with lingering chocolate and prune. Drink this chunky, superripe Priorat sooner rather than later.\n59426\tSpain\tReserva\t85\t\tCentral Spain\tValdepeñas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Albali 2001 Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)\tTempranillo\tViña Albali\tLT_90_Points\tLots of oak results in aromas of bacon, charred beef, cinnamon and heavy berry fruit. The wine is big and clangy, but not harsh. The flavors of berries mixed with greens and vanilla are nervy, while in the end the wine shows a solid mouthfeel and decent structure.\n48787\tSpain\tBlanc Selecció\t86\t17\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tHuguet de Can Feixes 2014 Blanc Selecció White (Penedès)\tWhite Blend\tHuguet de Can Feixes\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of peach pit are neutral except for some oily notes. This multigrape blend feels plump, oily and propped up by solid acidity. Pithy flavors of grapefruit and melon are slightly bitter on the finish.\n68621\tSpain\tHoya de Cadenas Reserva\t85\t10\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVicente Gandia 2011 Hoya de Cadenas Reserva Tempranillo (Utiel-Requena)\tTempranillo\tVicente Gandia\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy, leathery aromas of plum and berry are a touch rustic. This feels rubbery and raw, but fresh. Dry, earthy plum flavors are limited, while the finish is short, with a tight, chalky feel.\n113225\tSpain\tPrestigio Crianza\t89\t32\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEmina 2014 Prestigio Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tEmina\tLT_90_Points\tLeathery blackberry, vanilla and tobacco aromas include a gritty burnt note that's not entirely welcome. This feels full and oaky, with good balance. Oak-based flavors of vanilla and mocha sit atop black-fruit notes, while this is balanced yet tannic on the finish, with a lingering flavor of vanilla. Drink from 2018–2023.\n117916\tSpain\tI Unacepa\t92\t49\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValduero 2012 I Unacepa  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tValduero\tGT_90_Points\tRipe, baked black-fruit aromas go heavy on the raisin and prune, with a hint of spice cake thrown in. On the palate, this is saturated and a bit thick. Baked berry, cassis and creamy oak flavors finish lush and chewy, with flavors of oak grain and chocolate. Drink now through 2020.\n97120\tSpain\tGn\t82\t21\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa Primicia 2008 Gn  (Rioja)\tGarnacha\tCasa Primicia\tLT_90_Points\tA rusty color is a give-away that this Garnacha isn't in the best shape. The nose smells of cotton candy and Kool-Aid. The feel is flat, grabby and tannic, while the flavors are scattershot, with brown sugar notes and dry leafiness on the finish.\n43425\tSpain\t\t89\t65\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAstrales 2013  Ribera del Duero\tTinto Fino\tAstrales\tLT_90_Points\tBlack cherry and cassis aromas are bold but basic. This feels fiercely tannic and astringent. Meaty flavors of cherry and black plum end with dried berry notes, prune and rock-hard tannic bite. Give this more time if possible, but like many 2013s it might never soften and improve.\n52878\tSpain\tTinto Viñas Viejas\t92\t68\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGarcía Figuero 2013 Tinto Viñas Viejas  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tGarcía Figuero\tGT_90_Points\tSmoky hickory and meat aromas overshadow this wine's berry scents. On the palate, it rattles about like an untied load. Berry and black plum flavors come with more than enough oak, which is reflected on the toasty, char-laced finish. Drink 2019–2026.\n60153\tSpain\t\t84\t10\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTapeña 2007 Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tVerdejo\tTapeña\tLT_90_Points\tApple and modest dusty white-fruit aromas are about all you'll get from the neutral bouquet, while the palate is sweet and a little candied, with apple and mango flavors. Fleshy and chunky, but good enough to enjoy in a casual setting. Probably a good base wine for white sangria.\n124797\tSpain\tReserva\t88\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSierra Cantabria 2007 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tSierra Cantabria\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose on this reserva is roasted and meaty, with dark berry accents. The palate delivers a flush feel and volume along with flavors of roasted plum, herbal raspberry and salt. There's tobacco and pimiento on the finish, and for a subpar vintage the wine is still very good. Drink now through 2017.\n42637\tSpain\t\t87\t7\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCrucillon 2009 Garnacha (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha\tCrucillon\tLT_90_Points\tA perfectly solid Garnacha with pepper, bright red fruit and a touch of country style to the bouquet despite its pedestrian price. The palate is bright and tastes of plum and red berry, while the feel is good and the finish fruity and lively. What inexpensive red wine should be.\n20572\tSpain\tOld Vine\t86\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValcantara 2012 Old Vine Garnacha (Cariñena)\tGarnacha\tValcantara\tLT_90_Points\tPinched and wiry-smelling on the nose, this Garnacha comes around with earthy red-berry aromas in front of a full, chunky, fairly oaky palate. Flavors of blackberry and vanilla are good but common, while the finish is dense but basic.\n121863\tSpain\tReserva Old Vine\t83\t15\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGabarda 2008 Reserva Old Vine Red (Cariñena)\tGrenache Blend\tGabarda\tLT_90_Points\tWith aromas of milk-chocolate-covered cherries and forced oak, this smells overtly sweet and candied. This feels choppy and juicy, with red fruit flavors and buttery oak in the background. It turns sweeter and more buttery on the finish, but doesn't offer much complexity.\n50398\tSpain\tLimited Edition\t86\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRamón Bilbao 2009 Limited Edition  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tRamón Bilbao\tLT_90_Points\tCoarse on the nose, this has scratchy aromas of unripe red fruit, green herb and grass. It feels forward but choppy, with zesty acidity pushing its familiar flavors of red fruit and herb. A bit stalky and leathery on the finish, it ends with a vanilla streak.\n123572\tSpain\tReserva\t83\t10\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Vieja 2004 Reserva Tempranillo (La Mancha)\tTempranillo\tFinca Vieja\tLT_90_Points\tThere's virtually no bouquet to this wine, and the palate follows suit with a flat feel and hollow, faded flavors of balsamic-doused cherry and herb. It seems aged and dried out.\n126866\tSpain\tCabernet Sauvignon\t84\t15\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPríncipe de Viana 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon Rosado (Navarra)\tRosado\tPríncipe de Viana\tLT_90_Points\tThis is almost red in color, with spicy bell pepper aromas resulting from early harvested Cabernet Sauvignon. Its full, chunky palate shows yeasty, lightly green and peppery flavors that linger on the finish.\n108085\tSpain\tBarbazul\t86\t25\tAndalucia\tVino de la Tierra de Cádiz\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tHuerta de Albalá 2012 Barbazul Red (Vino de la Tierra de Cádiz)\tRed Blend\tHuerta de Albalá\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of black-olive juice, animal hide and seashell fail to offer much fruit, even with swirling. A tough palate shows no clear point of entry, while herbal black-fruit flavors draw in rather than expand on the finish. This is a Syrah-led blend with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Graciano, aka Tintilla de Rota. It hails from Cádiz.\n31562\tSpain\tHacienda Zorita Natural Reserve Unamuno Vineyard\t90\t30\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y León\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de la Concordia 2014 Hacienda Zorita Natural Reserve Unamuno Vineyard Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)\tSyrah\tMarqués de la Concordia\tGT_90_Points\tDark, heady berry aromas are intense and oaky, with a cured-meat note of beef jerky. A deep, layered palate is savory and meaty in flavors, with light herbal notes embedded into berry and plum fruit. A spicy, peppery, lightly charred finish is the final chapter. Drink through 2019.\n100827\tSpain\t\t88\t13\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa L'Angel 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Valencia)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCasa L'Angel\tLT_90_Points\tRound, sweet and ripe smelling, then tight and rubbery in the mouth, with full tannins that smack down with force. The palate is medium in depth, with dark plum and berry flavors in front of a sweet, molasses-tinged finish. Very good for affordable Spanish Cabernet.\n91688\tSpain\tBecquer\t81\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Escudero 2009 Becquer White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tBodegas Escudero\tLT_90_Points\tAlmond candy and lacquer aromas create a corny scent on the nose. This wine feels flabby and soggy, with buttery oak and little to no fruit flavor. Finishes woody, with vanilla and spice. A blend of 60% Viura and 40% Chardonnay.\n20155\tSpain\tBrut Rosé\t83\t12\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMas Fi NV Brut Rosé Trepat (Cava)\tTrepat\tMas Fi\tLT_90_Points\tThis is briny, earthy and pickled on the nose, while the foamy palate offers peach and orange flavors that finish pithy.\n17473\tSpain\t\t89\t14\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOtazu 2015 Chardonnay (Navarra)\tChardonnay\tOtazu\tLT_90_Points\tDry, wooly aromas of apple and peach pit are steady.

The palate is properly crisp yet not sharp, and the flavors of green apple and white grapes are snappy. Regular and a little better than good in every way, but ultimately more basic than special.\n29073\tSpain\tRosado\t86\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tIlurce 2010 Rosado Rosé (Rioja)\tRosé\tIlurce\tLT_90_Points\tReddish in color and big on the bouquet, with sweet berry and cherry aromas. The palate is full and fun, with acidity and heavier, sweeter flavors of strawberry, raspberry and sweet plum. Handles its size well. Made from 80% Garnacha and 20% Graciano (for acidity).\n77751\tSpain\tGaudium\t86\t45\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Cáceres 2008 Gaudium  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarqués de Cáceres\tLT_90_Points\tCompost, tomato leaf and gritty berry aromas control the nose on this underripe and tannic Rioja. Stalky flavors of tomato and berry fruits are definitively herbal, while the finish is toasty due to oak covering but also rough and stalky.\n112745\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t33\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tÉbano 2006 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tÉbano\tLT_90_Points\tStarts out oaky and cheesy, with baked berry, leather and clove-like aromas. The palate has lots of size, clacky tannins and acidity, while flavors of berry, mocha and tobacco are nice and lead to a toasty, grabby finish. Typical for RDD in that it's tough and tannic but full of brash flavor; drink now–2015.\n106612\tSpain\tJoven\t83\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tHemar 2006 Joven  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tHemar\tLT_90_Points\tCondensed up front, with aromas of berry compote and molasses. So why is this so tangy and tart in the mouth? Maybe the grapes weren't as ripe as they seem from the nose, and in the end it fails the all-important balance/wholesomeness test.\n4552\tSpain\tProtocolo\t81\t7\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio de Eguren 2011 Protocolo Rosé (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tRosé\tDominio de Eguren\tLT_90_Points\tThis is no longer in its prime. It tastes weird, mealy and slightly exotic, while the palate feels rubbery. Nectarine and plum notes are detectable on a strained finish.\n89097\tSpain\t\t87\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Valdemar 2011  Rioja\tTempranillo\tBodegas Valdemar\tLT_90_Points\tWild berry, cherry and mint notes are what you'll find on this wine's open, likable bouquet. The feel is clean and crisp, with snappy wild-berry and plum flavors that crackle with finishing acidity and controlled tannins.\n87920\tSpain\t\t85\t9\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCoto de Hayas 2015 Garnacha-Syrah (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha-Syrah\tCoto de Hayas\tLT_90_Points\tAlthough this opens with foxy aromas that suggest moderate to sketchy ripeness, this Garnacha-Syrah blend feels pretty good. Mild oak, plum and berry flavors are racy on an acidic finish.\n12588\tSpain\tLimited Release\t86\t15\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVionta 2011 Limited Release Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tVionta\tLT_90_Points\tButterscotch and candle wax aromas signal a wine in the early stages of decline. In addition, this shows dusty apple and mild citrus scents. The palate is being kept upright by citrusy acidity, while flavors of nectarine and citrus end with bready, aged notes. Drink immediately or wait for the 2012.\n72893\tSpain\tFinca Monte Alto\t91\t25\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFillaboa 2013 Finca Monte Alto Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tFillaboa\tGT_90_Points\tPeach and floral aromas are ethereal and reach out. This is round and full on the palate, but minerally and cut by citric acidity. Flavors or orange, mango and caramel end with ripe peach and melon flavors. Drink through 2016.\n3341\tSpain\tCovello\t84\t15\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLo Nuevo 2012 Covello Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tLo Nuevo\tLT_90_Points\tPeach and apple aromas are fruity but not precise or minerally. This has peachy acidity but a wide, unfocused palate. Flavors of peach and nectarine are tasty but lack the crispness that Albariño is known for.\n43969\tSpain\tPrestigio\t91\t70\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMatarromera 2005 Prestigio  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tMatarromera\tGT_90_Points\tDeep and dark, with cola, blackberry and mossy aromas. This is full-bodied, tight and tannic, with hardness that will only be tempered by food and/or more time in bottle. Tastes bold, chunky and ripe, with chocolate and licorice along with heat and tannic fire. Drink now through 2017.\n117624\tSpain\tPremium Moscatel\t86\t16\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDelgado Zuleta NV Premium Moscatel Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tDelgado Zuleta\tLT_90_Points\tDespite some heat and burn to the nose, there's nothing not to like about aromas of pecan pie and toffee. This Moscatel sweetie is solid in feel, but mostly around the edges; the middle palate is a bit weak. Flavors of brown sugar and caramel are more sweet and simple than complex.\n125040\tSpain\t\t85\t13\tCentral Spain\tExtremadura\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMad Dogs & Englishmen 2009 Red (Extremadura)\tRed Blend\tMad Dogs & Englishmen\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine used to come from Jumilla and contain Monastrell in addition to Shiraz and Tempranillo; now it's from Extremadura, with Carignan instead of Monastrell. It's rudimentary on the nose and scouring in the mouth, with firm tannins and sharp acids. The palate pulses with raspberry and plum fruit, then finishes with resiny grip and oaky flavors.\n64401\tSpain\tReserva\t89\t80\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tResalte 2005 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tResalte\tLT_90_Points\tGritty on the nose, this has baked bean, mushroom, roasted plum and earth aromas. It feels blocky and tannic, with some cushion to the palate. Oaky tasting, with prune, vanilla and buttery notes that settle on baked fruit and chocolate. It comes on forceful and heavy and is arguably a little overripe.\n91246\tSpain\t\t85\t13\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Galana 2014 Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tVerdejo\tViña Galana\tLT_90_Points\tSimple light aromas of vanilla and lees set up a round palate with ample acidic kick. For the most part, this is chunky and weighty, with apple and peach flavors, while mild bitterness in the form of peach pit closes this out.\n76380\tSpain\tSigilo MV\t86\t\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Recuero 2009 Sigilo MV Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Recuero\tLT_90_Points\tInitially the nose on this blend from the Toledo area offers dark cherry and hard spice aromas, but with airing things drop off to soupy and herbal. The palate feels wiry and choppy, with hard tannins and a mix of herb, tomato, plum and vanilla flavors. On the finish, it's lactic, with a lot of vanilla and jammy weight.\n124037\tSpain\tBrut Nature\t83\t14\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBiutiful NV Brut Nature Macabeo-Chardonnay (Cava)\tMacabeo-Chardonnay\tBiutiful\tLT_90_Points\tBriny, minerally, dusty aromas of white currant and crushed vitamins set up a foamy, lazy palate. Salty flavors of apple and persimmon finish flat, with a briny aftertaste.\n55141\tSpain\tKila\t87\t10\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVins El Cep 2014 Kila Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tVins El Cep\tLT_90_Points\tApple, vanilla and a hint of sulfur is what you'll find on the nose of this consistently solid value-priced Cava. A slightly soft body and flavors of green herbs, melon and white pepper finish well.\n6065\tSpain\tEmbocadero\t89\t22\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodega San Pedro Regalado 2011 Embocadero  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tBodega San Pedro Regalado\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a bit clipped on the nose, with notes of saline, seashell, metal, leather and earthy blackberry. The palate feels wide and a touch wayward, while leathery berry and plum flavors include a note of mushroom. Lemony oak and herbal notes rise up on the finish.\n57867\tSpain\tSelección\t93\t38\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArrocal 2010 Selección  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tArrocal\tGT_90_Points\tElegant yet ripe on the nose, this gets going in fine form via spicy, exotic, oaky aromas on top of primary berry tones. Powerful and oaky on the palate, with a creamy vanilla flavor, this brings on the blackberry, mocha, cocoa and toast as it works its way to a clean, long finish. One can drink this now, but the optimum window will be 2018–2021.\n16550\tSpain\tDama de Toro\t84\t11\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Fariña 2010 Dama de Toro Malvasia (Toro)\tMalvasia\tBodegas Fariña\tLT_90_Points\tAbnormal by white wine standards, with oily aromas of smoked meat, air freshener and exotic spices. Feels flabby but also dilute, with just enough verve to keep it alive. Flavors of melon and apple are round and spicy, but it's already breaking up and won't last much longer.\n38011\tSpain\tTierras de Luna\t87\t30\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y León\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLuna Beberide 2005 Tierras de Luna Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)\tRed Blend\tLuna Beberide\tLT_90_Points\tThis is Luna Beberide's “kitchen sink” blend consisting of Mencia, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine has blackberry and violet aromas, and as a whole it's inviting and smooth. Flavors of berry fruit are solid but modest, while herbal accents and baking spice notes jazz things up. With more follow-through and some artistic touches, this could be even better. As is, it's a perfectly good red blend.\n20134\tSpain\t1887 Brut\t84\t13\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCavas Hill NV 1887 Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tCavas Hill\tLT_90_Points\tYeasty, candied aromas rest in front of a foamy palate that lacks polish. This tastes like 7-Up and fresh grass, with sweet, yeasty, green-herb flavors that dissipate quickly on the finish.\n114222\tSpain\t\t92\t69\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPaixar 2011 Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tPaixar\tGT_90_Points\tRipe, jammy raspberry and blackberry aromas come with pastry notes and a strong blast of woodspice. This strapping wine has staunch tannins and hard-pushing acidity. Flavors of toast, blackberry and pepper lean toward the dark side, while the wine's handsome finish is secure in structure, balance and length. Drink through 2020.\n80563\tSpain\t\t87\t25\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tZarate 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tZarate\tLT_90_Points\tLeesy, cheesy aromas fall apart as this struggles a bit to present a clean front side. Almost dilute in feel, this tastes of cidery apple, nectarine and lees. On the finish, a hint of popcorn rises up.\n10205\tSpain\tBrut Nature Reserva de la Fami\t86\t17\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\t\t\tJuvé y Camps NV Brut Nature Reserva de la Fami  (Penedès)\tChampagne Blend\tJuvé y Camps\tLT_90_Points\tBone-dry and austere, this is a wine for people who feel that fruit and sugar have no place in a sparkling wine. The aromas are of sun-baked earth and dust, with a trace of vanilla and white chocolate. All you really experience on the palate is acidity, alcohol and weight, although if you try hard you can imagine a squeeze of lime. It’s very clean.\n101128\tSpain\t\t91\t26\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbad Dom Bueno 2008 Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tAbad Dom Bueno\tGT_90_Points\tA potent Mencía with concentrated berry aromas along with intense oak, rubber and graphite notes. Full-bodied and sound as a boulder, with balance, tannic grip and rousing flavors of black cherry, blackberry and dark spices. Toasty and black on the finish; top-shelf Bierzo to drink now through 2015.\n43917\tSpain\t\t93\t61\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSan Vicente 2012  Rioja\tTempranillo\tSan Vicente\tGT_90_Points\tThis modern-style Tempranillo is registering at max ripeness. Aromas of black fruits, raisin, tire rubber and toasty French oak project a dark outlook. In the mouth, this is tight and gripping. Flavors of blackened oak, cassis and blackberry finish firm and closed, with manageable tannins. Drink through 2025.\n47782\tSpain\tTempus\t88\t22\tCatalonia\tTerra Alta\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAltavins 2013 Tempus Red (Terra Alta)\tRed Blend\tAltavins\tLT_90_Points\tAromas suggest berry fruits, spice. A full, creamy, grabby palate is weighty, while flavors of varied black fruits are oaky and chocolaty. On the finish, this tastes roasted and a bit hot, with a note of salt. This is two-thirds Garnacha along with Syrah and Samsó (Carignan).\n71691\tSpain\tOpera Prima Pink Moscato\t86\t8\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJ. Garcia Carrion NV Opera Prima Pink Moscato Sparkling (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tSparkling Blend\tJ. Garcia Carrion\tLT_90_Points\tThis salmon-colored sparkler is fruity up front, with berry and cotton candy aromas. The palate is crisp and well cut, while flavors of nectarine, mango and honey finish crisp. A good, basic sweet quaffer.\n126186\tSpain\tCapellanía\t88\t26\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Murrieta 2005 Capellanía White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tMarqués de Murrieta\tLT_90_Points\tFor those who like an old-school, oxidized style of white Rioja (think López de Heredia), Murrieta's Capellanía is up your alley. The nose is almost like Sherry in its creamy, maderized state, while the palate is low in power, with coconut and lemon flavors. Finishes soft, with vanilla. A unique, identifiable white wine that's not for everyone. Drink now.\n64955\tSpain\tRoble\t83\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLegón 2008 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tLegón\tLT_90_Points\tWarm and smelling of menthol, cough syrup and sweet, jammy berry fruit. The palate is also fairly medicinal in terms of flavor, while the feel is a bit hard and underdeveloped. Turns more tart and herbal the more you get to know it.\n66606\tSpain\t\t87\t20\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAltos de Cristimil 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tAltos de Cristimil\tLT_90_Points\tBasic aromas of white fruits and pumpkin precede a sharp palate with a high malic acid content. Tart apple, gooseberry and salty flavors run long due to blazing acidity.\n93980\tSpain\tArtazuri\t85\t11\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArtadi 2014 Artazuri Rosado (Navarra)\tRosado\tArtadi\tLT_90_Points\tMatchstick sulfur and background red-fruit aromas lead into a simple palate that's wet and lively but doesn't offer a lot to latch onto. Generic citrus and cherry Lifesaver flavors finish with a note of briny salt.\n21745\tSpain\tThird Generation Dama de Toro\t84\t11\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Fariña 2011 Third Generation Dama de Toro Malvasia (Toro)\tMalvasia\tBodegas Fariña\tLT_90_Points\tDistant aromas of melon, lemon and apricot are subtle and fail to stir the pot. This feels weighty, with pithy flavors of peach, papaya and melon. On the finish, flavors of white pepper and bitterness take over.\n117301\tSpain\tRosat\t82\t19\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGarbó 2013 Rosat Rosé (Montsant)\tRosé\tGarbó\tLT_90_Points\tOxidized and flat on the nose, this has a palate with mealy, bland strawberry flavors. Nothing changes on a fading, less-than-fresh finish.\n54096\tSpain\tJavier Asensio Tinto\t83\t10\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAsensio 2003 Javier Asensio Tinto Red (Navarra)\tRed Blend\tAsensio\tLT_90_Points\tAlmost volatile, but with reduced raisin below. If you are familiar with   hot-climate California Zinfandel, this is not unlike that. It has a vinegary attack and then a strange but limited sweetness lurking in the weeds. A   challenged wine.\n89615\tSpain\tBarón de Lajoyosa Gran Reserva\t87\t25\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tIgnacio Marín 2005 Barón de Lajoyosa Gran Reserva Red (Cariñena)\tRed Blend\tIgnacio Marín\tLT_90_Points\tHeavy aromas of baked berry fruits and raisin suggest a bit of overripeness. On the palate, that take is confirmed by chunky weight offset by natural acidity. Flavors of oak barrel, raisin and tart plum cover a wide spectrum, while this blend of Garnacha, Tempranillo and Carignan finishes long, with black-fruit flavors. Drink now.\n97070\tSpain\tFlos de Pinoso Made With Organic Grapes Macabeo & Airén\t86\t13\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Bodega de Pinoso 2009 Flos de Pinoso Made With Organic Grapes Macabeo & Airén White (Alicante)\tWhite Blend\tLa Bodega de Pinoso\tLT_90_Points\tApple and mineral aromas are basic but clean, and the palate is fresh and lithe, with little to no extra weight. Flavors of dry apple and fresh corn work well, and while the finish is short and shy, it's crisp and clean. A simple wine with light fruit and easy drinkability.\n77871\tSpain\tTorre la Moreira\t85\t18\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Vizhoja 2011 Torre la Moreira Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tMarqués de Vizhoja\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose on this Albariño deals tropical fruit and vanilla scents. It feels citrusy, with modest flavors of papaya, peach and white melon. After showing moderate vitality on the palate, the finish softens up and slips into the netherworld. Seems as though it's beginning to fade.\n62168\tSpain\tNegre\t90\t20\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJaspi 2008 Negre Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tJaspi\tGT_90_Points\tDeep and dark on the nose, with licorice, cola and prune aromas. The palate is chunky and full, albeit a touch soft. Saturated flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate define it as a rich, modern wine, and the finish is appropriately creamy and stacked with sweetness and depth. A lush blend of Garnacha, Cabernet and two indigenous varieties. Drink now through 2011.\n103825\tSpain\tSerres Tempranillo-Garnacha\t83\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCarlos Serres 2012 Serres Tempranillo-Garnacha Rosé (Rioja)\tRosé\tCarlos Serres\tLT_90_Points\tWith an orange leaning to its pink tint, this is struggling to maintain its fruit and freshness. Flavors of peach and apricot pits finish round and soft.\n113633\tSpain\tRosé\t86\t11\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSegura Viudas NV Rosé Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tSegura Viudas\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of melon, mango and papaya are more yeasty than fresh and alert. This Trepat-based rosé feels foamy and soda-like. Flavors of citrus, melon and brown sugar finish slightly flat but fruity.\n57478\tSpain\t\t86\t22\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Vinculo 2009 Red (La Mancha)\tRed Blend\tEl Vinculo\tLT_90_Points\tFull, pushy aromas of stewed plum, tomato, herbs and heavy oak come in front of a high-acid palate with salty flavors of herbal red plum, oregano, basil and tomato. A saline character sits heavily on the wine's chunky finish.\n56941\tSpain\t\t83\t28\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAltos de Torona 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tAltos de Torona\tLT_90_Points\tWaxy, oxidized aromas suggest Sherry and late-harvest wines. A peachy, fully mature palate offers apricot and papaya flavors in front of a salty, dry finish with fino Sherry notes.\n12369\tSpain\tMarina Espumante Gran Selección 10°\t85\t15\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBocopa NV Marina Espumante Gran Selección 10° Monastrell (Alicante)\tMonastrell\tBocopa\tLT_90_Points\tReduced aromas of cassis and blackberry come with a whiff of wet dog. This foamy sparkling red is heavy on the palate, without much delicacy. Black cherry and boysenberry flavors are candied but not cloying, while a foamy, blocky finish is fruity yet ponderous due to low acidity.\n105638\tSpain\tLeda Viñas Viejas\t93\t45\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y León\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Leda 2005 Leda Viñas Viejas Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Leda\tGT_90_Points\tEarly on it displays mild heat and jamminess, but with airing everything settles, and ultimately this old-vines Tempranillo from the lauded winemaker Mariano Garcia excels. The palate is rich, minerally and meaty, with slightly syrupy black fruit flavors, molasses and chocolate. Chewy, tannic and pure on the finish, with hints of herbs and lemon peel. Drink now through 2013.\n109005\tSpain\t\t88\t22\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbad Dom Bueno 2013 Godello (Bierzo)\tGodello\tAbad Dom Bueno\tLT_90_Points\tThis comes across a bit dilute on the nose, with aromas of green melon and underripe banana. The palate shows good weight, balance and a lightly oily texture. Minerally flavors of nectarine and peach finish solid, with lasting acidity providing support.\n85011\tSpain\tRívola\t81\t17\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y León\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbadia Retuerta 2004 Rívola Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo\tAbadia Retuerta\tLT_90_Points\tWhat's up with this once proud value leader? Wines of character and balance used to be the norm (circa 2001-2002) but now Rívola has devolved into an herbal, green wine with difficult aromas and vegetal flavors. The mix is 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Tempranillo.\n75551\tSpain\tSeco Reserva\t82\t9\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\t\t\tJaume Serra NV Seco Reserva  (Penedès)\tChampagne Blend\tJaume Serra\tLT_90_Points\tA simple and slightly sweet sparkler, although it’s labeled seco, or dry. Vegetable-herb notes on the nose open to sweet and earthy flavors. The bead is large and the mouthfeel very soft. Useful for a toast with your older aunties—who tend to like ’em sweet—and fine for mimosas with brunch.\n1906\tSpain\tÀn\t89\t53\tSpanish Islands\tVi de la Terra Illes Balears\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tÀnima Negra 2004 Àn Red (Vi de la Terra Illes Balears)\tRed Blend\tÀnima Negra\tLT_90_Points\tOverall this Callet-led blend might exceed its more oaked, richer brother known as Son Negre. Àn has a rooty, oak-driven nose with hints of herbs and tobacco, while the palate is dark and tasty, with blackberry, cherry and cured meat flavors. Finishes with pepper and a lash of leftover oak that hopefully will disappear as the wine ages. Drink now through 2012.\n11575\tSpain\tViña Albina Gran Reserva\t91\t35\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Riojanas 2009 Viña Albina Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Riojanas\tGT_90_Points\tSavory, mature aromas of woodspice and earthy berry fruits form the greeting on this gran reserva that's more lively than subdued or silky. Spicy, oaky berry flavors have a ripe, rooty component, while there's just enough pop to a bold, baked, chocolaty finish. Drink through 2026.\n86578\tSpain\t\t85\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo Clavijo NV  Rioja\tTempranillo\tCastillo Clavijo\tLT_90_Points\tAfter wading through some burn and heat on the nose, things settle on basic red fruit. The feel is fresh and zesty, while flavors of plum and berry are about as average and normal as they come. Feels racy, slick and quick on the finish.\n38465\tSpain\tMR Mountain Wine\t85\t35\tAndalucia\tMálaga\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodríguez 2009 MR Mountain Wine Moscatel (Málaga)\tMoscatel\tTelmo Rodríguez\tLT_90_Points\tOn first take, this is oily and smells of bitter almond and walnut. The mouthfeel is clunky and heavy, with low acidity. Bitterness is the lead flavor, and then honey and brown sugar enter the picture. On the finish it struggles to drive through the tape.\n99656\tSpain\tCosme Palacio 1894 Tinto\t88\t60\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Palacio 2008 Cosme Palacio 1894 Tinto  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Palacio\tLT_90_Points\tGenerally 88-pointers don't call for cellaring, but this one could gain style points with time in the bottle. Now it's dark and promising, with berry, cherry, earth and tobacco. It's also hard but manageable, with lightly herbal blackberry, cherry and brown sugar flavors. Finishes dark and toasty.\n16187\tSpain\tSelección Privada\t92\t70\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Vargas 2010 Selección Privada  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarqués de Vargas\tGT_90_Points\tMaple, mocha and raisin aromas announce an oaky, fully ripe wine with roasted tomato notes. The palate is saturated with mixed berry, spice and chocolatey oak flavors, finishing with heavy residual tannins. Drink this oaky powerhouse through 2028.\n72230\tSpain\t\t91\t75\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTerroir Al Límit 2005 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tTerroir Al Límit\tGT_90_Points\tA tiny production wine with class and style. It's toasty and dark, with bold black cherry and cassis aromas offset by ample minerality. From the town of Torroja, this 233-case wine is full of molasses, black cherry and other rich, brandied flavors. And it finishes warm, with caramel, coffee and other major-league attributes. Hold until 2010, if possible.\n83491\tSpain\tColección Vivanco Parcelas de Mazuelo\t88\t95\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDinastía Vivanco 2007 Colección Vivanco Parcelas de Mazuelo  (Rioja)\tMazuelo\tDinastía Vivanco\tLT_90_Points\tMazuelo is almost always a blending grape for a reason: it's limited in depth and weighty. So it's no surprise that this opens with leather, prune and bullish jam and liqueur aromas. The palate, however, is kind of sharp and lacking depth, while the flavor profile is juicy, herbal and folds in cassis and berry. Snappy and acidic for an expensive varietal wine.\n109631\tSpain\tMétodo Tradicional Brut\t82\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Cantosán NV Método Tradicional Brut Sparkling (Rueda)\tSparkling Blend\tViña Cantosán\tLT_90_Points\tBriney and cidery smelling, with a heavy, disjointed, cloying palate. Herbal and grassy on the finish, with a sweet, green aftertaste offset by some bitterness. Verdejo is the grape, and that's not common.\n42244\tSpain\tSeis\t89\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLuberri 2011 Seis  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tLuberri\tLT_90_Points\tSlightly foxy on the nose, with rubbery aromas of cherry and cassis, this offers a tight, tannic palate with hard, elastic tannins. Flavors of cherry and cassis are pleasant, while the finish is ripe, warming and healthy.\n108240\tSpain\tFino Dos Palmas\t92\t45\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGonzález Byass NV Fino Dos Palmas Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tGonzález Byass\tGT_90_Points\tIntense, well-directed aromas are staunch, woody and suggest turpentine before pulling back. A lemony palate is loaded with citric acidity, which creates an electric mouthfeel. Nutty, citric and zesty on the finish, this is a superb artisan fino with a high level of complexity.\n89518\tSpain\tReserva\t84\t10\tCentral Spain\tAlmansa\t\t\t\tCastillo de Almansa 1995 Reserva Red (Almansa)\tRed Blend\tCastillo de Almansa\tLT_90_Points\tTart cherry aromas and flavors with tarragon accents are wrapped in oak in this medium-weight, mature red. The wine is evenly textured, but the oak sits well to the fore, really predominating on the very dry, tangy-in-a-woody-way finish. —M.M.\n45853\tSpain\tCrianza\t84\t9\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Vieja 2007 Crianza Tempranillo (La Mancha)\tTempranillo\tFinca Vieja\tLT_90_Points\tThis has raisin, earth, mint and dried herb aromas. It feels narrow, but concentrated, tasting of earthy tomato, baked plum and fresh green herb. It has a solid mouthfeel, with a mildly briney finish.\n16880\tSpain\tGran Feudo\t85\t12\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Julián Chivite 2007 Gran Feudo Rosé (Navarra)\tRosé\tBodegas Julián Chivite\tLT_90_Points\tClean, fresh and simple. Gran Feudo will neither thrill nor disappoint as it delivers adequate citrus, raspberry and rhubarb flavors propelled by choppy, stinging acids. It shows a good attack before breaking up on the finish. A can't-fail rosé for the summer and fall of 2008.\n89127\tSpain\tAlma de Blanco\t88\t15\tGalicia\tMonterrei\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPazo das Tapias 2008 Alma de Blanco Godello (Monterrei)\tGodello\tPazo das Tapias\tLT_90_Points\tA little heavy and sweet on the nose, but juicy and deep on the palate, with round, pleasant lemon, grapefruit and green melon flavors. Dry, pure and driving white wine with a long, clean finish. Galician Godello in good form.\n25289\tSpain\t\t86\t15\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPazo Torrado 2012 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tPazo Torrado\tLT_90_Points\tLeesy, dusty aromas are pithy and lose freshness with airing. This feels full and moderately acidic, with tropical flavors of melon, apple and banana. A sweet-tasting finish is mild in feel and meets expectations for everyday Albariño.\n85008\tSpain\tEl Cerezo Unoaked\t81\t12\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo de Monjardin 2005 El Cerezo Unoaked Chardonnay (Navarra)\tChardonnay\tCastillo de Monjardin\tLT_90_Points\tThis rating is a follow-up to one we did about a year ago, and it doesn't seem as though this wine is making any progress. It's still clumsy as an ox, with stark pineapple flavors and overt acidity. Citrus juice is the best way to describe it; it bears little to no resemblance to Chardonnay as we know it.\n83812\tSpain\tMas Mallola\t93\t50\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarco Abella 2013 Mas Mallola Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tMarco Abella\tGT_90_Points\tAromas of berry, cherry and earthy schist are what the Priorat is known for. This wine feels tight and pure, with firm tannins and a gritty personality. Toasty flavors of mocha, black cherry, raspberry and cassis are generous, while the finish is fresh, tight, balanced and indicates that midterm aging will only help; drink 2017–2022.\n101514\tSpain\tTrenzado\t88\t22\tSpanish Islands\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSuertes del Marqués 2015 Trenzado White\tWhite Blend\tSuertes del Marqués\tLT_90_Points\tHailing from the volcanic soils of Tenerife in the Canary Islands, this blend of Pedro Ximénez and Listán Blanco opens with aromas of citrus peel and honey. A powerful palate is angular and smacking. Salty citrus flavors reflect an ocean influence, while the wine is strong on the finish.\n49346\tSpain\t\t89\t24\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tClos Gebrat 2013 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tClos Gebrat\tLT_90_Points\tRipe and oaky up front, a sweet vanilla aroma is redeemed by darker notes of blackberry and asphalt. Jammy and full bodied, the palate delivers boysenberry, herbs and creamy oak flavors. The heavy, chewy finish is dense and ripe.\n57641\tSpain\t\t92\t85\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tO. Fournier 2008  Ribera del Duero\tTinto del Pais\tO. Fournier\tGT_90_Points\tCool berry, graphite, cola and prune are the lead aromas on this ripe RDD. In the mouth, choppy tannins and firm acids create a strong, edgy feel. Flavors of cassis, wild berry, coconut and vanilla announce ripeness and plenty of oak. It finishes with abrupt tannins, tons of residual flavor and weight. Drink now through 2021.\n81533\tSpain\tPS-Xtrem Organic\t88\t32\tCatalonia\tAlella\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlta Alella 2012 PS-Xtrem Organic Red (Alella)\tRed Blend\tAlta Alella\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of aged cheese, leather, latex and medicinal cherry and plum lead to a juicy, acid-driven palate with buttery oak as the offset. Flavors of oak-related butter, popcorn and saline push this creamy red toward the finish line, but all the while fruit is secondary to oak. Drink through 2018.\n83884\tSpain\tPeitán\t89\t15\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNora 2011 Peitán Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tNora\tLT_90_Points\tButtercup and fresh pear aromas are friendly and inviting. It feels full and correct, with good acids and minerality. Flavors of pears, melons and lees are very nice, while the finish is simultaneously flowery, crisp and salinic.\n78788\tSpain\tViña Albina Reserva\t92\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Riojanas 2010 Viña Albina Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Riojanas\tGT_90_Points\tDusty aromas of cocoa, herbs and spice grace prune and plum scents. This is firm, layered and healthy in mouthfeel. Flavors of baked plum, blackberry and mocha finish dry and well balanced. This has more than a few years left in it.

Its blackberry, black plum and cedar aromas are broad and lush. Chocolaty oak flavors enwrap its ripe blackberry fruit, remaining rich and long on the finish. Drink 2018–2026.\n41156\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t89\t\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBaron De Ley 2007 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBaron De Ley\tLT_90_Points\tSavory, baked aromas of raisin, leather and spice control the nose on this traditional Rioja GR. The palate shows lively acidity and flavors of savory spices, oak, rubber and baked berries that finish with pulse and layering. This isn't great but it's a very good, classic Tempranillo.\n14215\tSpain\t\t89\t20\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValtea 2010 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tValtea\tLT_90_Points\tLemony smelling but otherwise straightforward, with citrus blossom and apple aromas. Seems just creamy enough in the mouth, with mild citrusy acidity and normal, likable flavors of apple and orange. Uncomplicated, clean and ready to drink.\n40992\tSpain\t\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Coto 2007 Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tEl Coto\tLT_90_Points\tEl Coto has gotten its game in gear in recent years. The brand's value-priced wines like this Viura are clean and proper. In this case, opening aromas of stone and lime yield to green fruits and cucumber. The wine is easy and fresh, with a juicy, simple mouthfeel.\n88256\tSpain\t\t89\t15\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOphalum 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tOphalum\tLT_90_Points\tCorrect aromas of tropical fruits are slightly briny. This feels focused and citrusy, with good body and a few curves. Orange and grapefruit flavors, the skins and peel included, finish with a juicy, bright citric character.\n98726\tSpain\tCrianza Tradicional\t85\t15\tCatalonia\tCatalunya\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCampo Lindo 2009 Crianza Tradicional Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo (Catalunya)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo\tCampo Lindo\tLT_90_Points\tRipe, soft and pillowy on the nose, this blend is wide and lazy on the palate, with raisin and prune flavors offset by moderate acidity. A loamy, raisiny finish confirms a sense of ripeness and weight.\n7363\tSpain\t\t88\t25\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tZarate 2012 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tZarate\tLT_90_Points\tThis shows stalky, corny notes on the nose along with mineral and white-fruit scents. There's a lemony quality to an otherwise neutral palate, while saline, lemon and mild but increasing bitterness control the flavor profile and finish.\n7416\tSpain\tCrianza\t86\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Cáceres 2005 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarqués de Cáceres\tLT_90_Points\tBramble and brine are present on the nose, and while 2005 was a very good vintage in Rioja, this wine brings a little less than expected. It's endowed with snappy red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, and there's also vanilla and herbal notes. The feel is dry, medium-bodied and grabby, with a hint of stemmy snap.\n42527\tSpain\tMonte Real Gran Reserva\t90\t45\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Riojanas 2001 Monte Real Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Riojanas\tGT_90_Points\tSmoky and earthy smelling, with aromas of tobacco, subtle spice and dried cherry. This feels tight, with more acidity than body at this point in its evolution. Flavors of dried raspberry, plum, earth and brown sugar are solid and classic. Drink now through 2013.\n29638\tSpain\tQubél\t88\t53\tCentral Spain\tVinos de Madrid\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGosalbez Orti 2003 Qubél Red (Vinos de Madrid)\tRed Blend\tGosalbez Orti\tLT_90_Points\tRoasted and dark, with full blackberry and smoked-meat aromas. Organic Tempranillo, Syrah, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon comprise this tight, dark, rugged wine with forward tannins and acidity bolstering cherry, cassis and   cola flavors. Made in the modern, ripe style. Drink now–2010.\n48976\tSpain\tVertus\t82\t10\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Iranzo 2009 Vertus Tempranillo (Utiel-Requena)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Iranzo\tLT_90_Points\tJammy and flat smelling, with little to no depth to the nose. The palate is snappy but there's just enough body to offset the acidity, while the flavors of red fruits are tart and regular. Dull tasting, with a fairly long finish that's unexciting.\n129723\tSpain\t\t90\t30\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMas de Subirà 2012 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tMas de Subirà\tGT_90_Points\tA mix of raisin and forest floor are the lead aromas on this concentrated yet rustic Carignan-led blend. In the mouth, firm tannins frame flavors of roasted plum and peppery spice, leading softly into a surprisingly demure finish.

The palate is heavy but acidic, with sulfuric notes and flavors of grapefruit and citrus pith. Tangy, grabby and tannic on the finish.\n60532\tSpain\tRoca Roja\t89\t255\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarco Abella 2013 Roca Roja Garnacha (Priorat)\tGarnacha\tMarco Abella\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of burnt wood and spice cover rugged gritty berry scents. This is a tight minerally wiry Garnacha that's oaky on the palate. Oak-rich plum flavors finish with strong tannins, residual grit and lasting wood-based notes. Drink through 2022.\n85048\tSpain\tBelezos Crianza\t89\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Zugober 2007 Belezos Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Zugober\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with alluring, classic aromas of spice, cinnamon, leather, vanilla and tomato along with raspberry. The palate is firm, healthy and dry, with tea, baked berry, dill and cinnamon flavors. Aged six months in American oak, this is a textbook Rioja crianza that's smooth, herbal and on the money.\n107316\tSpain\t\t87\t18\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tV&N; Cellars 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Cariñena)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tV&N; Cellars\tLT_90_Points\tLeathery, stalky berry aromas are a bit rustic, and so is the feel. But the flavors on this Cabernet from Cariñena are satisfying and forward, suggesting stewed plum, baked berry and sun-drenched warmth. This is almost cooked but it pulls back. At six years of age it is what it is; drink now.\n84939\tSpain\tAbadia de San Quirce Reserva\t90\t45\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Imperiales 2004 Abadia de San Quirce Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Imperiales\tGT_90_Points\tA round, chewy wine with a nice mix of black fruit, vanilla, aged cheese and light balsam wood on the nose. The palate is big but doesn't bite back, and the flavors of creamy berry are broad and nice. A very solid wine with weight and heat; drink now through 2011.\n91146\tSpain\tFederico Paternina\t88\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de la Concordia 2015 Federico Paternina Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tMarqués de la Concordia\tLT_90_Points\tDusty apricot, peach and citrus aromas come in front of a snappy, basic palate with racy acidity. Citrus, banana and pineapple flavors finish fresh and modest. This is nice and perfectly appealing. It's ideal for patio sipping.\n88219\tSpain\tSelección\t84\t24\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Elciego 2008 Selección  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tMarqués de Elciego\tLT_90_Points\tConcentrated and smoky, with shoe polish and other black aromas. It's ultratight in the mouth, collapsing on itself more than expanding. Flavors of earth and berry are loud. Rugged feeling on the finish.\n11738\tSpain\tCampo Burgo Reserva\t89\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Campo Nuble 2006 Campo Burgo Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tMarqués de Campo Nuble\tLT_90_Points\tRoasted and charred, with a a clear and present barrel influence along with thyme, herbs and tomato leaf. In the mouth, it's sweet and ready, with ripe berry flavors touched up by cocoa. Toasty and a little minty on the finish, but flavorful and perfectly good as a whole.\n61017\tSpain\tDominio de Heredia\t84\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAltanza 2008 Dominio de Heredia  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tAltanza\tLT_90_Points\tStarts out heavy and roasted, with herbal, earthy berry aromas settling in. Feels pruney but there's also acidity, while the flavors run herbal and peppery as prune and plum represent the fruit side. Decent but doesn't fully click.\n22677\tSpain\tCrianza\t90\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPalacio del Burgo 2013 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tPalacio del Burgo\tGT_90_Points\tCharred, earthy black-fruit aromas are smoky and power-packed. This feels full yet balanced, with freshness and strong tannins. Ripe berry, prune and oak-spice flavors finish with a note of vanilla and length. For a Crianza from a tough vintage, this is commendable.\n63712\tSpain\tAmandi\t88\t24\tGalicia\tRibeira Sacra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDon Bernardino 2012 Amandi Red (Ribeira Sacra)\tRed Blend\tDon Bernardino\tLT_90_Points\tThis blend of Mencía, the local Grand Noir and Merenzao opens with raisiny, spicy, slightly baked aromas that suggest nutmeg. The palate is drawing and hard, with earthy, slightly cooked flavors of cherry and kirsch that end with a dash of lemony oak.\n61798\tSpain\tColección Vivanco Dulce de Invierno Late Harvest\t85\t50\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVivanco 2011 Colección Vivanco Dulce de Invierno Late Harvest Red (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tVivanco\tLT_90_Points\tAn aromatic opening of compost and vinegar might suggest casting this aside. But flavors of strawberry and chocolate, along with an admitted weedy note, amount to something decent. Finishing notes of brown sugar and berry syrup are chocolaty and ensure that this finishes better than it begins.\n94734\tSpain\tLeopardi Gran Reserva Brut Nature\t91\t35\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLlopart 2009 Leopardi Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tLlopart\tGT_90_Points\tPunchy yet secure aromas of apple, pear, grass and green herbs are expansive. A forward, layered, sensuous palate delivers yeasty, toasty apple and pear flavors. On the finish, softness, depth and richness share space alongside acidity and length. Drink through 2019.\n57198\tSpain\tReserva\t90\t36\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca La Emperatriz 2008 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tFinca La Emperatriz\tGT_90_Points\tLeathery, baked aromas of earthy berry fruits and coffee grinds take time to unwind.

In the mouth, creamy oak and high acidity clash, while a lead flavor of chocolaty oak struggles to blend with tart saucy red-fruit notes. A milk chocolate flavor is most prominent on a hollow finish.\n96778\tSpain\tEl Bon Homme\t88\t20\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Rafael Cambra 2012 El Bon Homme Red (Valencia)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Rafael Cambra\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy, dusty aromas of sawdust and latex accent plum and blackberry scents.

Flavors of fine oak, copious spice and complex berry are more than satisfying, while the finish is long, dry and composed, featuring a note of cinnamon.\n39796\tSpain\tReserva Single Vineyard\t87\t30\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOchoa 2002 Reserva Single Vineyard Red (Navarra)\tRed Blend\tOchoa\tLT_90_Points\tRooty and sweet smelling, with tobacco, burnt brown sugar and raisin aromas. The palate is thick, stacked and jammy, with raisin, tobacco and candied prune and cherry flavors. Very tasty and sweet but a little flat and old.\n81375\tSpain\tSolaz\t82\t7\tCentral Spain\tTierra de Castilla\t\t\t\tOsborne 1999 Solaz Red (Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo Blend\tOsborne\tLT_90_Points\tStriving for complexity with plenty of cedary, toasty wood over cherry fruit, this Castilian Tempranillo–Cabernet blend aims high. It falls short of its aspirations, turning lean and somewhat astringent as green tobacco, herb and puckery, tart red fruit flavors take over. Finishes short and slightly raspy.\n70789\tSpain\t\t85\t13\tNorthern Spain\tSomontano\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBatán de Salas 2013 Chardonnay (Somontano)\tChardonnay\tBatán de Salas\tLT_90_Points\tA peachy nose includes the botrytis aromas you get in late-harvest Alsace whites and Sauternes. Linear and still lively on the palate, this tastes a bit woody but also of muddled stone fruits. A chunky finish is peachy tasting.\n88017\tSpain\tMas Suau Brut Nature\t86\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFerré I Catasús NV Mas Suau Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tFerré I Catasús\tLT_90_Points\tA bit heavy and corny, with a strong influence of tortilla and corn chips on the nose.

This is a small-production wine (1,000 cases total) that leans on core acidity to keep it propped and steady. It's not the most complex game in town, and maybe it's on its way to having seen better days even if 2005 was a benchmark vintage.

This varietal Macabeo feels citrusy, while lightly bitter flavors of almond skins, citrus pith and green melon finish with simplicity and a note of nectarine.\n95354\tSpain\tO Rosal\t91\t24\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTerras Gauda 2015 O Rosal Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tTerras Gauda\tGT_90_Points\tPeachy, floral aromas are friendly and clean. This blend of mostly Albariño and some Caiño Blanco and Loureira is round on the palate, with ample volume. Appealing flavors of melon, peach and apple finish dry and with a hint of white pepper. Wines like this are why almost everyone loves Albariño from Rías Baixas.\n112857\tSpain\t\t87\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tObalo 2009  Rioja\tTempranillo\tObalo\tLT_90_Points\tDark, smoky, heavily oaked and resiny, with aromas of char, leather and burnt toast. The palate is big and forceful, with a lot of oak character and also snappy blackberry, plum and buttery flavors. Modern and creamy, with enough quality fruit to back things up.\n46922\tSpain\tSein\t89\t45\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVinessens 2013 Sein Monastrell-Syrah (Alicante)\tMonastrell-Syrah\tVinessens\tLT_90_Points\tPlum and blueberry aromas display a hint of desert herbs. A full dense palate is jammy in feel, while blackberry and prune flavors come with herbal savory notes. A mix of toasty oak and prune-like flavors on the finish leave a lasting impression of maximum ripeness.

Bright, bold and energetic across the palate, this Crianza from a warm, dry year offers toasty oak, chocolate, spice, licorice and black-fruit flavors. As it moves towards the finish, toasty, blackened notes along with hints of mocha rise up. Drink from 2018–2028.\n107766\tSpain\tSweet Torito\t81\t11\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCosecheros y Criadores 2011 Sweet Torito Garnacha (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tGarnacha\tCosecheros y Criadores\tLT_90_Points\tScratchy, dusty red-berry aromas are decidedly sweet yet hollow. This semisweet Garnacha tastes of gummy red fruits. A flat, cloying finish with candied flavors confirms its sweet status.\n47824\tSpain\tIugiter\t89\t36\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Conreria d'Scala Dei 2008 Iugiter Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tLa Conreria d'Scala Dei\tLT_90_Points\tIugiter delivers berry, cola and licorice aromas in front of a racy, acid-rich palate that's linear in shape. Flavors of cherry, plum and raspberry are snappy and reflect a cool vintage, while the finish is equally racy, juicy and full of acidic snap.\n4336\tSpain\t\t90\t44\tNorthern Spain\tValdeorras\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAvancia 2014 Mencía (Valdeorras)\tMencía\tAvancia\tGT_90_Points\tAromas of sweet oak and maple announce that this Mencía received generous barrel treatment.

This is more acidic and narrow in the mouth than the aromas suggest, with tart flavors of raspberry and red plum. A lightly herbal, snappy feeling finish ends with a note of bitterness.\n97176\tSpain\t\t82\t13\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLuna Beberide 2007 Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tLuna Beberide\tLT_90_Points\tThe first 2007 reds from Spain are now appearing, and it seems like talk of a tough vintage are being confirmed. This wine is sheer and miserly. The nose is gaseous, while the flavors of blackberry and spice are seared by sharp, overt acidity. Shrill and not nearly as generous as the '06.\n17612\tSpain\tTerra de Cuques\t87\t50\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTerroir Al Límit 2015 Terra de Cuques White (Priorat)\tWhite Blend\tTerroir Al Límit\tLT_90_Points\tDusty, peachy aromas are mellow, while overall not a lot is happening on the nose. A somewhat collapsed, fallen palate is ultimately a bit flat. Mild apple and spice flavors last on a finish that's slightly bitter and tastes of almond.\n82688\tSpain\t\t88\t69\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNeo 2007  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo\tNeo\tLT_90_Points\tA good to very good wine with medicinality on the nose that takes over the aromatics. There's also the slightest bit of hard cheese and stem on the bouquet, so overall it is fighting an uphill battle. Along the way it delivers flavors of cough drop, cherry and a good, solid finish.\n80154\tSpain\tReserva Varietales\t88\t16\tCentral Spain\tUclés\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca La Estacada 2012 Reserva Varietales Red (Uclés)\tTempranillo Blend\tFinca La Estacada\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of ripe black fruits, graphite, dry herbs and licorice root are solid and encouraging. This Tempranillo blend from La Mancha feels choppy and tight, while screechy red-plum and cherry flavors finish a bit raw and hollow.\n112846\tSpain\tLuzon Verde Organic Grapes\t87\t9\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Luzón 2009 Luzon Verde Organic Grapes Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tBodegas Luzón\tLT_90_Points\tSatisfying from the purple color to the sweet bouquet to the clean palate to the long finish. It's a little simple and syrupy, but overall there's plenty of freshening acidity and flavors of plum, berry and chocolate to make it a complete and balanced wine. And that's really all you should hope for in this price category.\n6186\tSpain\t\t87\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMartinsancho 2016 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tMartinsancho\tLT_90_Points\tGrapefruit and grit show on the nose.

It's thick and awkward, with molasses on the nose then tomato, plum and herbal flavors. Lacks balance and mouthfeel while pouring on the weight.\n109861\tSpain\tPetit Albet Made with Organic Grapes Chardonnay-Xarel-lo\t86\t13\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlbet I Noya 2010 Petit Albet Made with Organic Grapes Chardonnay-Xarel-lo White (Penedès)\tWhite Blend\tAlbet I Noya\tLT_90_Points\tFeels sturdy and properly acidic, with melon, papaya and apple flavors running alongside almondy bitterness.

Bracing, racy acidity creates edge and sharpness on the palate, while hickory-smoked plum and raspberry flavors finish with firm tannins and dashing acidity.\n18883\tSpain\tCuvée TNS\t90\t144\tCentral Spain\tManchuela\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Sandoval 2007 Cuvée TNS Red (Manchuela)\tTouriga Nacional Blend\tFinca Sandoval\tGT_90_Points\tThis blend of 66% Touriga Nacional and one-third Syrah is unique for Spain but qualifies as “international” in style. Cola, blueberry and floral aromas dominate, giving way to an easy feeling palate with cola, molasses, brown sugar and blackberry flavors. It's flavorful and rich but not overly complex or layered; drink this magnum now through 2017.\n102005\tSpain\tCrianza\t84\t13\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSeñorío de Sarria 2005 Crianza Red (Navarra)\tTempranillo Blend\tSeñorío de Sarria\tLT_90_Points\tEarly tobacco and mint aromas quickly yield to mossy black fruit, and in the mouth it's fresh and zesty, with mild green-pepper infused plum and cassis flavors. Quite crisp and lean, with herbal influences showing up at all points. Classic Navarran red wine.\n111500\tSpain\tValdehermoso Crianza\t92\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValderiz 2011 Valdehermoso Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tValderiz\tGT_90_Points\tPure cherry, blackberry and plum aromas are dense, toasty, minerally and smoky. Intense plum and blackberry flavors soften a bit on a loamy, lightly baked finish. Overall, this is a ripe, thoroughly drinkable RDD with tons of fruit and well-applied oak. Drink through 2020.\n118501\tSpain\tLuzon\t88\t9\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Luzón 2012 Luzon Red (Jumilla)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Luzón\tLT_90_Points\tFirm aromas of black plum, black cherry and sugar beet give way to power and lots of body on the palate. This delivers the goods in the form of chocolate and herbal berry flavors, which are backed by minty, dry oak notes on the finish.\n59937\tSpain\t\t88\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Coto 2009 Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tEl Coto\tLT_90_Points\tGood, clean and pleasant.

Medium- to full-bodied and even, it closes with mouth-puckering woody tannins. Those more oak-tolerant will find much more to like here. —M.M.\n51805\tSpain\t\t86\t14\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBovale 2014 Bobal (Utiel-Requena)\tBobal\tBovale\tLT_90_Points\tRed-fruit aromas come with a hint of animal, something that's not uncommon to Bobal.

The color is dark and opaque, while the nose offers perfume, Middle Eastern spice, fruitcake and solid black fruit. Enticing in the mouth, where full black fruit flavors are pumped up by fine herb and spice notes. And then coffee and chocolate fill the finish. Drink now through 2010.\n61668\tSpain\tEl Bon Homme\t87\t20\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRafael Cambra 2013 El Bon Homme Red (Valencia)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tRafael Cambra\tLT_90_Points\tScratchy cherry and raspberry aromas are lightly herbal.

Aromas of rubber and scrambled egg veer toward boysenberry and cassis, while the palate is grabby and jammy. Flavors of baked black fruits, prune and licorice finish pasty and oaky, with a note of sweet plastic.\n101688\tSpain\tCrianza\t87\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Cáceres 2007 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarqués de Cáceres\tLT_90_Points\tClear and focused, with raspberry and edgy spice aromas to the nose. The palate doesn't bring a whole bunch of meat or heft, but it is clean, racy and food-friendly. Flavors of red berries and pepper are normal and expected, while the finish is dry and lean.\n86701\tSpain\tAntaño\t82\t8\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJ.

The briny palate is all about dried citrus and nuts, while the earthy, long finish has an unmistakable and very nice mushroom quality. This is a precise, somewhat reserved and dainty amontillado, but it's structured and quite real as far as style and impact.\n110029\tSpain\tApostoles Vinum Optimum Rare Signatum\t93\t50\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGonzález Byass NV Apostoles Vinum Optimum Rare Signatum Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tGonzález Byass\tGT_90_Points\tAromas of burnt orange and baking spices are upright and snappy for a Sherry that's fairly creamy.

It’s very dry and faintly fruity. Has a bit of a scouring quality from high acidity, and it’s rough, but it’s exceptionally clean and brisk.\n37809\tSpain\t\t85\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEmina 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tEmina\tLT_90_Points\tTropical fruit, passion fruit and lime aromas are a bit sweaty and suggestive of pine resin. This is low on spine and verve, meaning it's a touch flat and flabby. Briny nectarine and tarragon flavors finish with green notes of scallion and lime.\n98005\tSpain\tTempranillo\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBeronia 2016 Tempranillo Rosado (Rioja)\tRosado\tBeronia\tLT_90_Points\tNeutral aromas and a light pink color suggest this will be an easy ride.

Hailing from a subpar vintage, it is acidic, with oaky resin on the mouthfeel.

The nose reeks of reduced blueberry and cassis, while the palate is soft, low in acidity and full of ripe, dark raisin, prune and spice cake flavors. If you like a dense wine, this is it. But expect it to be Port-like and on the liqueur-ish side. Drink now.\n29651\tSpain\tConde de Valdemar Reserva\t88\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Valdemar 2003 Conde de Valdemar Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Valdemar\tLT_90_Points\tA very nice and approachable wine from a tough year, so congratulations to Conde de Valdemar for putting out this smooth, layered reserva that delivers basic, no-nonsense raspberry and cherry aromas and flavors.

It feels good but slightly sticky, with flavors of vanilla, coconut, tomato, red plum and herb. This feels good on the finish, with tobacco, vanilla and oak flavors. Drink now through 2015.\n67525\tSpain\t\t88\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Montepedroso 2013 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tFinca Montepedroso\tLT_90_Points\tFriendly aromas of apple and stone fruits are inviting and clean. This is cutting on the palate, but not overly so, with a good feel and cleansing acids. Apple and lime flavors finish bright and uncomplicated.\n66756\tSpain\tMarina Alta\t85\t14\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBocopa 2015 Marina Alta Moscatel de Alejandría (Alicante)\tMoscatel de Alejandría\tBocopa\tLT_90_Points\tTypical Moscatel aromas suggest lychee and pineapple. This feels regular in every way, with no spritz or anything of interest in terms of texture. Flat lychee and tropical-fruit flavors finish with modest citrusy kick and a note of grape skins.\n3434\tSpain\t\t88\t24\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tChopo 2014 Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla)\tMonastrell-Syrah\tChopo\tLT_90_Points\tJammy plum and berry aromas come with dessert herb scents. A juicy palate doesn't offer much structure, but this Monastrell-Syrah blend tastes good courtesy of plum, blackberry and toasty flavors. The ripe warm finish is generous.\n57654\tSpain\tX\t87\t13\tCatalonia\tCatalunya\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBohigas 2015 X Xarel-lo (Catalunya)\tXarel-lo\tBohigas\tLT_90_Points\tLight aromas of mango, melon and lime are quiet but clean.

Caramel and carob mix with coffee and cola on the finish, and overall it is good RDD if you don't mind full extraction and syrupy richness.\n42268\tSpain\tExcelsus\t86\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Herminia 2014 Excelsus  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tViña Herminia\tLT_90_Points\tRubbery, generic berry and red-fruit aromas are decent, nothing more. This Garnacha-Tempranillo blend feels fresh, lean and wiry, with raw flavors of plum and red-berry fruits. A high-toned racy finish is the opposite of plush.\n80335\tSpain\tReserva\t91\t45\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Elciego 2005 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tMarqués de Elciego\tGT_90_Points\tA traditional style of Rioja with earthy, peppery, dry aromas in front of a healthy, lively palate.

Drink now through 2014.\n50419\tSpain\tReserva\t87\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEduardo Garrido García 2005 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tEduardo Garrido García\tLT_90_Points\tHot, stalky aromas of red chili flake and weedy raspberry lead to a lean, tomatoey palate with flavors of tomato, dried berry, vanilla and especially dill weed. A saucy, woody finish confirms that this is now mostly oak and acid; drink through 2020.\n59163\tSpain\tReserva\t84\t40\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Alconde 2003 Reserva Red (Navarra)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Alconde\tLT_90_Points\tInitial aromas are squarely in the bell pepper/jalapeño mode, and later moss and earth enter the picture. The palate is basic, a bit acidic, and saucy, with herbal red-fruit flavors and a finish of tomato and basil. Struggles a little, but solid in a “country” sort of way. The blend is Tempranillo, Garnacha, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.\n10520\tSpain\tBrut Exclusive Reserva\t88\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Gelida 2007 Brut Exclusive Reserva Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMarqués de Gelida\tLT_90_Points\tBegins with weight and yeasty, bready, white fruit aromas. The palate is round and full, with lime, apple and kiwi flavors. Zesty and proper on the finish, with good length and clarity. Solid and nice throughout.\n101533\tSpain\tGran Reserva Brut Nature Barrica\t90\t53\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAgustí Torelló Mata 2007 Gran Reserva Brut Nature Barrica Macabeo (Cava)\tMacabeo\tAgustí Torelló Mata\tGT_90_Points\tLike the barrica (barrel) in its name implies, this is a toasty wine, with vanilla, yeast and elegant white-fruit aromas. Full bodied, it has citrus and apple notes, with mild oxidation in front of the toasty finish. A classy Cava to drink now.\n10545\tSpain\tVia Edetana\t90\t20\tCatalonia\tTerra Alta\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEdetària 2012 Via Edetana Red (Terra Alta)\tRed Blend\tEdetària\tGT_90_Points\tGenerous berry aromas smell floral. In the mouth, this is plump and soft in the middle but more tannic and stout on the edges. Baked blackberry, plum and cassis flavors finish with hard tannins and a sense of extraction. Expect a very full, chunky and ultimately satisfying Garnacha-based ride.\n25254\tSpain\t\t87\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCondesa Eylo 2013 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tCondesa Eylo\tLT_90_Points\tWhite-fruit and melon aromas are widespread and mellow. This is chalky feeling, with citric acidity in charge. Flavors of apple, nectarine and lime finish clean and typical of the variety and region.\n86304\tSpain\tClos Torribas Rosé\t84\t10\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPinord 2007 Clos Torribas Rosé Tempranillo (Penedès)\tTempranillo\tPinord\tLT_90_Points\tLatex, rubber band and other roasted, rubbery aromas send up the red flag, yet the palate and flavors are good enough even if they are already a little tired and rusty. Not really recommended given that rosé should be fresh and fun. This one veers to big berry fruit and softness. 100% Tempranillo. Imported by National Distributing Co., Inc.\n87691\tSpain\tVendimia Seleccionada\t87\t21\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tResalte 2014 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tResalte\tLT_90_Points\tGritty, roasted aromas of herbal black fruits come up a touch short of fully ripe and convincing. This feels flush, with manageable tannins. Flavors of salty, roasted blackberry and dark plum continue to the tannic finish.\n93957\tSpain\tRoble\t83\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPago del Vostal 2008 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tPago del Vostal\tLT_90_Points\tCreamy and confected on the nose, which is proof of the “roble” designation. The palate is rather narrow and acidic, with semi-sour flavors of berry and cherry. Cleansing and tart; decent but doesn't go beyond that.\n1540\tSpain\t\t85\t10\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tClos de Nit 2015 Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tClos de Nit\tLT_90_Points\tThe tomato and plum aromas in this Garnacha blend are a bit soupy.

A solid, middle-of-the-road pour.\n5816\tSpain\tProtocolo\t84\t7\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio de Eguren 2013 Protocolo White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tWhite Blend\tDominio de Eguren\tLT_90_Points\tLime, melon and citrus aromas are basic but clean. The palate is pulpy in feel, while pithy flavors of white grapefruit and generic citrus fruits finish with a mild note of papaya.\n32082\tSpain\tVal do Salnés\t89\t25\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMar de Frades 2014 Val do Salnés Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tMar de Frades\tLT_90_Points\tLook for the blue bottle and you'll get a solid Albariño. This is typically light and fresh, with aromas of stream water, wild flowers, fresh herbs and leesy stone fruits. Crisp and citric on the palate, with proper cut, this tastes of orange, peach, nectarine and lemon. Minerally, cleansing and steady on the finish.\n6529\tSpain\tOld Vines Crianza\t83\t13\tCentral Spain\tValdepeñas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Navarro López 2009 Old Vines Crianza Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Navarro López\tLT_90_Points\tA jammy raspberry aroma comes with milk chocolate and plastic scents. It feels pulpy yet spunky, with red plum and strawberry flavors. The mild finish doesn't evolve or expand, but it registers as being fresh.\n66827\tSpain\tFamilia Reyes Reserva\t87\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBaronet 2011 Familia Reyes Reserva  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tBaronet\tLT_90_Points\tDusty earthy cherry and plum aromas are a bit spicy, while this feels blocky, with rubbery tannins. Spicy herbal plum and raspberry flavors show a mild green note on the finish.\n56868\tSpain\tMonte Real de Familia Crianza\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Riojanas 2014 Monte Real de Familia Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Riojanas\tLT_90_Points\tA dark color and stewy aromas of earthy berry fruits lead to a lush, lazy palate that tastes of toasty oak and roasted berries. A hot, minty and charred finish feels heavy.\n60710\tSpain\tEtiqueta Verde\t89\t18\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGranbazán 2014 Etiqueta Verde Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tGranbazán\tLT_90_Points\tLight fleshy aromas of peach and apricot lead to a tight juicy direct palate with pure, unadulterated flavors of pineapple, tangerine and apple. A crisp stony finish is fresh and in fine shape. This is a textbook racy Albariño to drink right away.\n18632\tSpain\tSparkling Rosé\t82\t10\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTarantas 2014 Sparkling Rosé Bobal (Valencia)\tBobal\tTarantas\tLT_90_Points\tYeasty, bready aromas of cantaloupe and citrus feed into an undefined palate that foams up on tongue. Citrus and melon flavors are bland, with powdered sugar and orange notes on the finish.\n17226\tSpain\tAbat Domènech\t86\t49\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCesca Vicent 2008 Abat Domènech Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tCesca Vicent\tLT_90_Points\tWith seven years in bottle, this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is what it is. The nose is stewy and raisiny, with baked berry notes. Like the nose, it feels raisiny and heavy. Flavors of raisin, fig and chocolate keep the theme going, while the finish is herbal and earthy in flavor, with heat.\n27930\tSpain\t\t85\t10\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPazo Serantellos 2010 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tPazo Serantellos\tLT_90_Points\tForward on the nose, with standard apple and white peach aromas. The palate is a bit clipped and short, with green-leaning flavors of scallion matched with grapefruit. Finishes citrusy.\n64212\tSpain\tReserva\t86\t14\tCentral Spain\tAlmansa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo de Almansa 2006 Reserva Red (Almansa)\tRed Blend\tCastillo de Almansa\tLT_90_Points\tLeather, roasted berry and barnyard make for a rustic, warm nose. The palate is grippy, with chewy, roasted black fruit flavors. Meaty, lasting, deep and dense, but also rubbery and a little low on acidic vitality. A Monastrell-Tempranillo blend to drink now.\n14279\tSpain\t\t86\t15\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBula 2011 Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tBula\tLT_90_Points\tInitially this smells herbaceous and scratchy, with green leanings. The palate is hard-driving and edgy, with a powerful package of savory berry flavors and rubbery tannins. A strong, lusty finish seems right for a rugged wine like this.\n85006\tSpain\tRosado\t82\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDarien 2006 Rosado Tempranillo (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tDarien\tLT_90_Points\tA wide-open, jumbled rosé without much focus or charm. There's peppery heat on the nose and then a lemony, citrusy palate that's at first soda-like and later kind of flat. Has acceptable intentions, but seems to be fading.\n60716\tSpain\tOld Vines\t84\t19\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa L'Angel 2010 Old Vines Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo (Valencia)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo\tCasa L'Angel\tLT_90_Points\tInitially, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo smells vegetal, although the nose settles on saucy tomato and bell pepper. Fairly raw and astringent on the palate, this tastes like pizza in a glass, meaning basil, oregano and tomato flavors are dominant. The finish is mildly green but feels right.\n73437\tSpain\t\t86\t12\tCentral Spain\tValdepeñas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPata Negra 2011 Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Valdepeñas)\tTempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon\tPata Negra\tLT_90_Points\tDry, earthy aromas of cherry and tree bark set up a juicy, pointed, drawing palate. Plum, cherry and currant flavors are zesty and pushed by raw acidity, while the finish is aggressive and racy. 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.\n21347\tSpain\tOrganic\t86\t11\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTarantas 2016 Organic Tempranillo (Utiel-Requena)\tTempranillo\tTarantas\tLT_90_Points\tSpicy berry fruit aromas are straightforward and pretty good.

Flavors of tea and spiced tomato lack fruit, and this wine is dry and somewhat abrasive on the finish. The blend is 80% Bobal with Cabernet Sauvignon.\n45148\tSpain\tCrianza\t86\t23\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbadía la Arroyada 2005 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tAbadía la Arroyada\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with tight black cherry and raspberry aromas, but also a whiff of pine and chemical. The palate is round, full and tannic, with snappy berry flavors accented by balasmic notes, oak resin and vanilla. Finishes with traditional vanilla-dill notes and a slight stemminess.\n13073\tSpain\tViña Alarde\t86\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBerberana 2009 Viña Alarde  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBerberana\tLT_90_Points\tBlack cherry and berry jam aromas bring a touch of raisin as well. The palate is mostly fresh and zesty, with medium weight and intensity along with crisp red plum and raspberry flavors. Tight, mildly acidic and a bit toasty on the finish.\n57863\tSpain\t\t86\t32\tNorthern Spain\tValdeorras\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAvancia 2014 Godello (Valdeorras)\tGodello\tAvancia\tLT_90_Points\tThis light-colored Godello smells mostly of oak and lees. The palate is dilute in feel, with yeasty flavors of banana and vanilla along with pithy bitterness and resiny oak. An overt candied sweetness takes over on the finish.\n113120\tSpain\tDamana Crianza\t88\t28\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas y Viñedos Tábula 2013 Damana Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tBodegas y Viñedos Tábula\tLT_90_Points\tFamiliar berry aromas blend with hard spice notes and a hint of blueberry. Like many 2013s, this is showing a clamped-down mouthfeel along with flavors of peppery black fruits. A limited finish is hard and compact. Drink or hold for another five or more years; this isn't going anywhere.\n14214\tSpain\tGetaria\t89\t25\tNorthern Spain\tGetariako Txakolina\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTxomín Etxaníz 2010 Getaria White (Getariako Txakolina)\tWhite Blend\tTxomín Etxaníz\tLT_90_Points\tWhen caught fresh, this is one of the Txakoli region's best wines. It comes on hard, clacky and tight as a box of nails, with citrus and minerally aromas. The palate is crisp and tight, with apple, lime, kiwi and spritz. Long, clean and refreshing.\n88536\tSpain\tColección Vivanco Parcelas de\t85\t90\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDinastía Vivanco 2008 Colección Vivanco Parcelas de  (Rioja)\tGarnacha\tDinastía Vivanco\tLT_90_Points\tRaisin, licorice and coconut aromas produce a ripe bouquet. This is raw and screechy in the mouth, with little in the way of a midpalate. Flavors of heavy red-berry fruits have a green leaning, while the finish is raw in feel and reedy in flavor.\n35509\tSpain\t\t81\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTramuz 2013  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo\tTramuz\tLT_90_Points\tHeavy oak on top of cherry aromas results in a chemical-driven, woody bouquet. This feels high in acid, with an oaky, resiny offset. Sour plum, vanilla and resiny flavors finish short, lean and citric.\n6953\tSpain\tLight Fino Jarana\t89\t17\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLustau NV Light Fino Jarana Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tLustau\tLT_90_Points\tMore yellow than Lustau's manzanilla, Jarana is a lovely, proper fino with a nose of iodine, lemon blossom and popcorn. The palate is staunch and doesn't back down; the high-toned nut and citrus flavors seem classic and elevated. And the finish is intense and frames everything in walnut oil and toast.\n71867\tSpain\tValdeleña Tinto Roble\t83\t20\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y León\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodega Melgarajo 2010 Valdeleña Tinto Roble Prieto Picudo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)\tPrieto Picudo\tBodega Melgarajo\tLT_90_Points\tCherry and plum aromas are basic and candied, while the palate on this Prieto Picudo-based wine is perky and acidic. The flavors run dilute and herbal, with cherry pie and tart raspberry notes. Lingering acidity makes the finish both fresh and sharp.\n124546\tSpain\tGlorioso Reserva Especial\t89\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Palacio 2007 Glorioso Reserva Especial  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Palacio\tLT_90_Points\tJammy raspberry aromas are easygoing and come with a hint of tobacco. It feels grabby but good, with lots of spice, pepper, herb and dark fruit flavors on the palate. The finish is healthy and well lifted, with a light but fresh herbal accent.\n123662\tSpain\tBlume\t84\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPagos del Rey 2014 Blume Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tPagos del Rey\tLT_90_Points\tBriny, minerally aromas of vitamin dust and lees feed into a yeasty, round, melony palate.

This is more fresh and fruity than weighty and yeasty. Slightly bitter, dry lime flavors are offset by sweeter pear and apple notes, while a lemon-lime flavor drives the finish.\n125213\tSpain\tSisquella\t85\t21\tCatalonia\tCosters del Segre\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tClos Pons 2013 Sisquella White (Costers del Segre)\tWhite Blend\tClos Pons\tLT_90_Points\tSmoky, sulfuric aromas put you on alert. This strange Catalonian blend of Garnacha Blanca, Albariño and Moscatel feels solid and centered, while salty papaya flavors are a touch bitter.

It feels scratchy in the mouth, with plum and red-fruit flavors. This wine runs short on  specifics while offering a juicy feel and a hint of chocolaty young oak on the finish.\n1847\tSpain\t\t83\t12\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMontevicor 2010 Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tMontevicor\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of raw oak, paint and dark-berry fruits lead to a medium-bodied palate with candied, oaky, mildly bitter black cherry and plum flavors. A modest finish closes with lasting bitterness and medicinality.\n109863\tSpain\tMiros\t86\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Peñafiel 2008 Miros  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Peñafiel\tLT_90_Points\tStarts out odd and exotic, with blueberry and Middle Eastern spice aromas. Feels condensed and jammy, with full flavors of herbs, boysenberry and plum. Shows freshness along with simplicity, with finishing herbal notes of sage and tarragon. Contains 10% each Merlot and Cabernet.\n16034\tSpain\tJoven Tinto\t88\t10\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuruve 2009 Joven Tinto  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tMuruve\tLT_90_Points\tFor a 60,000-case Toro, this is very good and well recommended. It smells full, leathery and slightly cheesy, with baked berry aromas. The palate is smooth, with minty, spicy, black fruit flavors. A hint of young oak rises up on the finish.\n16608\tSpain\t\t86\t13\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPeique 2013 Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tPeique\tLT_90_Points\tCutting aromas of rubbery red-berry fruits and wild herbs filter into a juicy, uncomplicated palate. Rubbery and medicinal tasting at first, this shows herbal raspberry and bitterness on the back end of the flavor profile and on the finish.\n65533\tSpain\tJoven\t84\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSeñorío de Sotillo 2013 Joven  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tSeñorío de Sotillo\tLT_90_Points\tBouncy, rubbery berry aromas come with latex and Band-Aid scents. A wiry, crisp mouthfeel sets up limited but spunky red-fruit flavors that are also a bit herbal and stalky. A briny finish shows juicy acidity but mediocre flavors.\n99029\tSpain\tPunto y Coma Viñas Viejas\t87\t20\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo de Maluenda 2012 Punto y Coma Viñas Viejas Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tCastillo de Maluenda\tLT_90_Points\tMinerally raspberry and plum aromas are smoky and woodsy in nature. This has a tannic mouthfeel and lightly medicinal, woodsy, briary blackberry and blackcurrant flavors that finish oaky and with a note of anise and/or licorice.\n47888\tSpain\tOld Vines\t88\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tShaya 2011 Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tShaya\tLT_90_Points\tThe apple and lime aromas are simple yet inviting. It feels round and mellow, maybe a bit low in acidity. The flavors of banana, vanilla bean and pear are friendly, while the finish is smooth and bears a tropical flavor.\n79971\tSpain\tDiamante Semi Dulce\t83\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Franco-Españolas 2011 Diamante Semi Dulce White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tBodegas Franco-Españolas\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of white gum drop and funky yeast set up a slightly cloying palate, with a candied flavor of pear. It transitions to notes of banana, mango and powdered sugar on the finish. A blend of Malvasia and Viura.\n99900\tSpain\tPata Negra Gran Reserva\t82\t15\tCentral Spain\tValdepeñas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Los Llanos 2004 Pata Negra Gran Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Los Llanos\tLT_90_Points\tHeavy oak-based aromas provide cover for the grassy, green scents. It feels clunky and grabby, with jumbled flavors of sweet oak and green-leaning fruit.\n25361\tSpain\tAlconte Crianza\t87\t32\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMontecastro 2009 Alconte Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tMontecastro\tLT_90_Points\tCompared to Montecastro's higher-end 2009s, this smells stalky and leathery, with herbal shadings accenting familiar black-fruit aromas. The palate feels grabby, while the flavors suggest charred leather, stalky berry and clove. The lasting impression is of a gamy, slightly hot wine that's good but has its weaknesses.\n81997\tSpain\tEnvite Crianza\t87\t22\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas San Prudencio 2007 Envite Crianza  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tBodegas San Prudencio\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with sweet fruit aromas, a whiff of oak and red candy, while the mouthfeeel is juicy and mostly fresh, with clean fruit flavors and more than adequate ripeness and sweetness. Fresh, composed and pleasant in the scheme of things.\n31124\tSpain\tViña Albina Crianza\t85\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Riojanas 2014 Viña Albina Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Riojanas\tLT_90_Points\tHeavy aromas of raisin, oak and chocolate are copied on the palate that tastes of oak, vanilla and raisiny fruit. It has a woody finish.\n27518\tSpain\tUnico\t89\t500\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVega Sicilia 2008 Unico  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon\tVega Sicilia\tLT_90_Points\tName and reputation get you only so far, as this underwhelming offering from a poor vintage proves. Compact stewy aromas of baked berry fruits and asphalt are the appetizer. A main course of chunky jammy stewy berry and prune flavors finishes with a desiccated essence. Unico is known to age for decades, but not this vintage. Drink now for what it's worth.\n16864\tSpain\tCrianza\t85\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tHemar 2005 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tHemar\tLT_90_Points\tA forward specimen with lots of oak that settles on cinnamon and wood tannin. Also a touch leafy on the nose, and that's backed by tangy cranberry and acid-driven cherry flavors. Very tight and piercing, which for a 2005 crianza is asking too much.\n32310\tSpain\tEstate Bottled\t88\t45\tCentral Spain\tDominio de Valdepusa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Griñon 2003 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Dominio de Valdepusa)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tMarques de Griñon\tLT_90_Points\tDusty black cherry and raspberry aromas are true to the variety, and the buttery quality on the palate adds weight and vanilla to the berry and cassis flavors. Overall this is a structured, fairly oaky wine with firm tannins and a toasty finish. Will go well with steak.\n67835\tSpain\t\t88\t17\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCon un Par 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tCon un Par\tLT_90_Points\tApple and other white-fruit aromas are appealing. The palate on this well-priced wine is nice and juicy, with a typical blend of green apple, peach and citrus flavors. This is fresh, minerally and linear on the finish. Drink now.\n45602\tSpain\t\t87\t15\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAljibes 2012 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tAljibes\tLT_90_Points\tGeneric red berry, licorice, baking spice and oak aromas set up a round, sticky, almost syrupy feeling palate. This multigrape blend tastes rooty and baked, with blackberry and stewed plum directing the flavor profile. Brown sugar and licorice flavors stick out on the finish.\n76234\tSpain\tViña Aljibes Cabernet  Sauvignon-Syrah-Cabernet Franc-Tempranillo\t88\t20\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAljibes 2012 Viña Aljibes Cabernet  Sauvignon-Syrah-Cabernet Franc-Tempranillo Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tRed Blend\tAljibes\tLT_90_Points\tPlum and berry aromas are lively and come with a mild scent of animal fur. This blend of four grapes, led by Tempranillo, feels blocky and loosely defined, while flavors of plum, raspberry and a touch of herbal green finish spicy and woody. Will function best as an everyday wine.\n1259\tSpain\t\t85\t7\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVenta Morales 2010 Tempranillo (La Mancha)\tTempranillo\tVenta Morales\tLT_90_Points\tBramble and red berry aromas are attractive and almost exotic. Feels a bit furry and scratchy, but tastes of blueberry with an herbal tinge. Finishes well, with a pinch of minty green flavor.\n90615\tSpain\tDon Jacobo Reserva\t83\t23\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Corral 2004 Don Jacobo Reserva  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Corral\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine is about as raisiny as it gets while still holding onto a sense of balance. Aromas of stewed berry fruits, prune and carob lead to a grabby, lemony tasting palate with raisin, vanilla and sweet tobacco on the finish.\n59065\tSpain\t\t84\t20\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPeique 2013 Godello (Bierzo)\tGodello\tPeique\tLT_90_Points\tPithy citrus aromas are heavy and strangely herbal for a white wine. Pulpy and wide in feel, with little midpalate structure, this tastes of citrus rind, white grapefruit and nopal. A zesty note reprises on the finish.\n60550\tSpain\tReserva\t89\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tYsios 2002 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tYsios\tLT_90_Points\tYsios is a ripe, smooth wine with polished aromas of black fruit, charred meat and vanilla. The palate has black cherry, plum, bacon and chocolate flavors, and the finish is smoky. Throughout there's a nice grilled character to the wine, which isn't very complicated and isn't likely to improve much with age. Drink now through 2010.\n107192\tSpain\tMenguante\t88\t16\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViñedos y Bodegas Pablo 2010 Menguante Garnacha (Cariñena)\tGarnacha\tViñedos y Bodegas Pablo\tLT_90_Points\tAlthough the bouquet is a bit scratchy, bright, lightly candied aromas of raspberry and strawberry jam are friendly and welcoming. The wine is firm on the palate and well built, with fresh, slightly jammy tasting plum and berry flavors. And it's lasting and fresh on the finish.\n14491\tSpain\t\t84\t10\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTrencalòs 2013 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo\tTrencalòs\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of tomato sauce and red-wine vinegar create sharpness on the nose. Plum and raspberry flavors run short, with a fresh, basic finish.\n64385\tSpain\tTerra Incognita\t89\t70\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Vilano 2005 Terra Incognita  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tViña Vilano\tLT_90_Points\tInviting aromas of tobacco, earth, cedar and bacon give weight to racy berry scents. It's stripped and tight as a drum on the palate, with fiery acidity creating tangy raspberry and plum flavors accented by notes of tobacco, wood spice and citrus. This is best enjoyed with food; on its own it's a bit sharp.\n3897\tSpain\tRoble\t86\t15\tLevante\tYecla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValle de Salinas 2008 Roble Red (Yecla)\tRed Blend\tValle de Salinas\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors. Warm, simple touches of licorice and mint define the finish. A blend of 60% Monastrell with 20% each Syrah and Tempranillo.\n46261\tSpain\tBrut\t86\t14\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMistinguett NV Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMistinguett\tLT_90_Points\tSoda pop-like on the nose, with a clear reference to Sprite and 7Up. The palate is somewhat candied and simple, but it has good feel and the flavors of lemon-lime are likable. Mild on the finish, with flavors that extend from the lemon-lime bouquet and palate.\n52489\tSpain\tSilencis\t88\t24\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRaventós I Blanc 2013 Silencis Xarel-lo (Penedès)\tXarel-lo\tRaventós I Blanc\tLT_90_Points\tMelon, apple and minerally aromas make this wine clean and steely on the opening. Lemony acidity combined with minerality gives this a Muscadet-like mouthfeel, while flavors of lemon, tangerine and lime are stony and sharp.\n33314\tSpain\t\t84\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCondado de Oriza 2006  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo\tCondado de Oriza\tLT_90_Points\tYoung and bouncy, and that's to be expected from this type of juvenile Tempranillo. However, should you like full-fruit young wines with force and no oak, it's not at all bad. Expect juicy black cherry and other runaway flavors.\n16275\tSpain\t\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tV&R; 2013 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tV&R;\tLT_90_Points\tTropical fruit aromas suggest mango and melon, but this wine is fading and shows a mealy side upon airing. The palate remains citrusy in feel, with grapefruit, nectarine and citrus peel flavors coming in front of a pithy finish.\n89678\tSpain\t\t84\t12\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Aragonesas NV Viura-Chardonnay (Campo de Borja)\tViura-Chardonnay\tBodegas Aragonesas\tLT_90_Points\tYeasty aromas are low on fruit and specifics. This Viura-Chardonnay blend is lazy in feel, with modest acidic cut. Sweet bland flavors quickly fall off and taste of powdered sugar on the finish.\n17094\tSpain\tLas Quebradas\t92\t42\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEnrique Mendoza 2010 Las Quebradas Monastrell (Alicante)\tMonastrell\tEnrique Mendoza\tGT_90_Points\tLicorice aromas are matched by herbal, horsey notes on this earthy, muscular Monastrell. A bold, high-volume palate is home to plum, currant and blackened flavors, while an integrated, lightly herbal finish is fresh and powerful, with a firm structure that will ensure at least several additional years of life. Drink through 2023.\n100312\tSpain\tPedra de Guix\t91\t90\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTerroir Al Límit 2014 Pedra de Guix White (Priorat)\tWhite Blend\tTerroir Al Límit\tGT_90_Points\tDespite a tan-meets-orange color, this Priorat white is fresh on the nose with apricot aromas. A solid texture with grip controls the palate, while dry white-fruit and orange-peel flavors end with slightly rubbery white-grape tannins.\n121176\tSpain\tGran\t92\t70\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tElias Mora 2004 Gran  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tElias Mora\tGT_90_Points\tWinemaker Victoria Benavides has maxed out the ripeness but has avoided any raisin, prune or molasses characteristics, which we like. Her Gran sits heavier on the palate than the 2004 Crianza, with firm tannins. But it also lingers more solidly on the back of the palate. To admire its purity and power, it's probably best to drink over the next four years.\n116515\tSpain\tSobre Lias\t87\t27\tNorthern Spain\tValdeorras\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGuitián 2006 Sobre Lias Godello (Valdeorras)\tGodello\tGuitián\tLT_90_Points\tThere's a fine line between a fresh Godello and one that's starting to turn. This one may soon fall into the latter category, but before it gets there look for peppery white-fruit aromas and flavors. Tastes of honeyed melon are  topped with cracked black pepper. Turns a bit creamy and sweet on the finish, another indication that it is starting to age.\n77286\tSpain\tRoble\t85\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVecordia 2011 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tVecordia\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of rubber band, smoky berry and plum come with herbal, rustic overtones. This feels grabby and tannic, while punchy acidity releases angular black-fruit flavors. A roasted, meaty tasting finish brings the heat and feels aggressive.\n115795\tSpain\tReserva\t93\t53\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPago de los Capellanes 2004 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tPago de los Capellanes\tGT_90_Points\tCapellanes waded through some weak efforts in 2002 and 2003, but this vintage marks undisputed excellence for a reserva. The wine has alluring smoky, sultry notes to match its bold fruit, while the flavors of blackberry, dark spice and chocolate announce perfect raw material and a deft winemaking hand, i.e. controlled oak. Delicious now through 2014.\n67626\tSpain\tRoble\t87\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLegón 2009 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tLegón\tLT_90_Points\tBerry, asphalt, leather and jammy notes pour off the bouquet on this full-bodied but fairly basic Tempranillo. Baked blackberry flavors are touched up by peppery spice and carob notes, while the finish is toasty and bitter like espresso.\n65004\tSpain\tAbadía de Gomariz\t86\t35\tGalicia\tRibeiro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCoto de Gomariz 2007 Abadía de Gomariz Red (Ribeiro)\tRed Blend\tCoto de Gomariz\tLT_90_Points\tThis small-production blend from Ribeiro is fragrant, with vibrant red-berry and floral aromas. In the mouth, it's tangy and lean, with more acidity than body. Flavors are mostly generic in nature, leaning towards cherry and plum, while the finish is raw. This is more of a food wine than a sipper.\n119518\tSpain\tAltos de Losada Viñedos Viejos Pequeñas Parcelas\t92\t36\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLosada 2015 Altos de Losada Viñedos Viejos Pequeñas Parcelas Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tLosada\tGT_90_Points\tDark aromas of graham cracker, blueberry, prune and creamy oak push the ripeness meter to high. This Mencía feels tight and a bit tannic, but also lush and a mile deep. Woody, smoky blackberry flavors finish with firm acidity, balance, depth and residual oak flavors that still need to be resolved; drink through 2024.\n10354\tSpain\tRoble\t87\t23\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEncanto 2012 Roble Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tEncanto\tLT_90_Points\tGrapy, balsamic aromas of blueberry and wild brush come with a hint of animal fur. Hard, edgy and compact in feel, this tastes punchy, with a note of vinegar and plum skins to an otherwise black-fruit flavor profile. Shallow, raw and tannic on the finish.\n9089\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t57\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPago de Carraovejas 2006 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tPago de Carraovejas\tLT_90_Points\tBig, bawdy, hard and concentrated, with black fruit and floral aromas. The palate is grabby and fully tannic, while the flavors run toward blackberry, coffee and vanilla. Rich and espresso-like on the finish, with no shortage of oak and richness. Very big at 15% alcohol.\n129615\tSpain\t\t84\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Riscal 2010 Rosé (Rioja)\tRosé\tMarqués de Riscal\tLT_90_Points\tNeutral on the nose, with peachy sweetness and softness that suggests it's beginning to fade. Feels honest but light, with pithy, neutral melon and red apple flavors. Dry but sort of bland; still upright. Drink right away.\n79623\tSpain\tCrianza\t90\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFelix Callejo 2007 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tFelix Callejo\tGT_90_Points\tFull and dark, with aromas of bacon, crusty minerality, black fruits and spice. Balanced yet bullish, with integrated tannins and toasty, coffee-infused flavors that go straight to black. Long and showing additional coffee on the finish. Drinkable now.\n29246\tSpain\tRoc Nu\t91\t30\tCatalonia\tCosters del Segre\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tClos Pons 2010 Roc Nu Red (Costers del Segre)\tRed Blend\tClos Pons\tGT_90_Points\tThis blend of Garnacha, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo opens with leathery, earthy aromas that suggest coffee grinds, black olive and stalky berry fruits. In the mouth, it comes through with a dense, layered feel and spicy flavors of baked berry fruits and black cherry. Overall this is a ripe, chewy, spicy wine with some rusticity. Drink through 2022.\n18328\tSpain\tMonte Real Crianza\t83\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Riojanas 2008 Monte Real Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Riojanas\tLT_90_Points\tBaked and raisiny smelling, with kirsch. In a word, it's stewy. Ditto for the mouthfeel, which is chunky and heavy. Features thick black plum, herb and carob flavors and feels beefy on the finish.\n98612\tSpain\tAmericano\t86\t16\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMont-Ferrant NV Americano Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMont-Ferrant\tLT_90_Points\tYeasty applesauce aromas precede a full palate that weighs on the heavy and flat side. Obtuse flavors of apple finish solid and chunky but low on acidity and crispness. Overall this is good but slightly lazy on the palate.\n116546\tSpain\tReal Reserva\t90\t25\tNorthern Spain\tCigales\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuseum 2003 Real Reserva Tinto del Pais (Cigales)\tTinto del Pais\tMuseum\tGT_90_Points\tOne of the Cigales region's big new wineries, Museum seems to be getting on track. This wine, from a very hot year, is composed, rich and in good balance. It has a slight baked character that's offset by almond candy, black cherry and toast notes. Black plum is the lead flavor, with coffee and molasses providing a rich background. Drink now and over the next two years.\n86855\tSpain\tPeramor\t84\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Copaboca 2014 Peramor Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tBodegas Copaboca\tLT_90_Points\tA gaseous smelling nose and a chunky palate are not motivational, while flavors of banana and melon aren't much better. Overall, this is a basic Verdejo that's starting to fade.\n108042\tSpain\t\t89\t27\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFernández Gómez 2010  Rioja\tGarnacha\tFernández Gómez\tLT_90_Points\tPointed red-fruit aromas of currant and plum are light but direct. This feels fresh, with mild raspberry flavors and not a whole lot else. On the finish, mellow notes of vanilla and red plum are supported by not overly aggressive tannins. Drink this fresh Garnacha through 2015.\n81532\tSpain\tRed\t88\t13\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGran Vinaio 2010 Red Grenache (Montsant)\tGrenache\tGran Vinaio\tLT_90_Points\tDeep, smoky aromas of black fruits are muscular and full. This is well structured and strong, with toast and dark-fruit flavors of blackberry and plum. Spicy, peppery flavors and mild heat drive the finish.\n98432\tSpain\tBlanc de Botes\t92\t45\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tClos Berenguer del Molar 2007 Blanc de Botes White (Priorat)\tWhite Blend\tClos Berenguer del Molar\tGT_90_Points\tThis property is flying below the radar...for now. This is yet another excellent wine from Clos Berenguer. The nose is full of butterscotch and oxidized aromas of fine Sherry. The palate has a big feel, purity and fine acidity, while flavors of smoke, toast and oxidized white fruits finish waxy, creamy, oaky and long. This Garnacha-heavy blend would go great with fish or lobster done in a butter sauce.\n53130\tSpain\tGlorioso Reserva\t89\t22\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Palacio 2013 Glorioso Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Palacio\tLT_90_Points\tBerry, cola and chocolate aromas are pretty. In the mouth, this wine is bright and brash, with rough tannins and high acidity. Flavors of plum and wild berry are a touch salty and then comes a hard-pounding finish. Drink through 2026.\n65042\tSpain\tExtra Dry\t86\t10\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSegura Viudas NV Extra Dry Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tSegura Viudas\tLT_90_Points\tA perennial Best Buy among cavas. The Segura Viudas Extra Dry is a light, easy taste of lemon-lime and sweet apples. It finishes just crisp enough and with some juiciness. Not overly sugary, although it is pretty sweet.

Citrus is the driving force from then on. There's tangerine and some melon for flavor, and plenty or orange and passion fruit on the finish. A drink-now citrus ball that's full and flavorful.\n53163\tSpain\tRoble\t86\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConde de Siruela 2011 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tConde de Siruela\tLT_90_Points\tHickory, roasted black fruit, vanilla, rubber and plastic aromas set up a big but balanced feeling palate. Flavors of roasted blackberry are rubbery and come with oaky vanilla, while this feels good on the finish with an overriding oak character in the driver's seat.\n119816\tSpain\tHerminia\t88\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Herminia 2014 Herminia  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tViña Herminia\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of raw oak, vanilla and cherry settle with airing, but this Rioja feels a bit wiry and choppy.

In the mouth, this is juicy and stony, with flavors of pithy green citrus and peach pit. The finish is solid and just crisp enough.\n635\tSpain\tCapellanía\t92\t28\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Murrieta 2010 Capellanía Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tMarqués de Murrieta\tGT_90_Points\tAromas of wood grain, vanilla, butter and fino Sherry are elegant and attractive for this style of white Rioja. On the palate, this oak-aged Viura is smooth, while creamy flavors of oak, apricot and peach excel. A smooth finish with plenty of vanilla and core acidity indicates this will age well for another 10 years.\n113143\tSpain\tMonopole\t87\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCVNE 2015 Monopole Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tCVNE\tLT_90_Points\tThis everyday Viura opens with yeasty aromas of green fruits and chewing gum.

This feels plump but not too heavy to be cut by a beam of firm acidity. Chunky leesy flavors of apple and kiwi finish fleshy, pulpy and round. Drink immediately.\n103388\tSpain\tBarrica\t88\t25\tGalicia\tRibeira Sacra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbadía da Cova 2008 Barrica Mencía (Ribeira Sacra)\tMencía\tAbadía da Cova\tLT_90_Points\tSmoky, rubbery and suggestive of bacon and toast on the nose. The palate is more crisp and snappy, with juicy flavors of red currant, cherry and spice. Acidity throughout yields a lemony finish, but it's also chiseled and tight, which should please traditionalists who like their acidic bite.\n88255\tSpain\tLacima\t89\t73\tGalicia\tRibeira Sacra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio Do Bibei 2010 Lacima Mencía (Ribeira Sacra)\tMencía\tDominio Do Bibei\tLT_90_Points\tThis rosy colored Mencía smells of floral plum and cherry, with hints of cinnamon and schist. On the palate, this is grabby, fleshy and rubbery, with big tannins. Raw, rubbery flavors of plum and currant are also minerally, while this finishes with lightly roasted red-fruit flavors, toasty oak and crisp, lasting acidity. Drink through 2020.\n92303\tSpain\tFuenteseca\t84\t12\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSierra Norte 2014 Fuenteseca Red (Utiel-Requena)\tRed Blend\tSierra Norte\tLT_90_Points\tBriary, herbal berry aromas precede a simple, inoffensive palate. Generic, slightly candied and herbal berry flavors end with notes of pepper and mild bitterness. This is 60% Bobal and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.\n7493\tSpain\tPlan B\t83\t19\tCatalonia\tTerra Alta\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCeller La Bollidora 2005 Plan B Red (Terra Alta)\tRed Blend\tCeller La Bollidora\tLT_90_Points\tHeavily stewed and raisiny, almost to the point of no return. And while the wine is definitely cooked and starchy, it rallies on the palate and finish to show some decent Priorat-style richness and flavor. But let's face it, the wine is 80% baked and won't last for much longer.\n7056\tSpain\t\t84\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBaron De Ley 2014 White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tBaron De Ley\tLT_90_Points\tLeesy, creamy aromas of vanilla are simple, with a note of apple offering some crispness.

The palate is more than competent and balanced, with creamy strawberry and raspberry flavors. The finish is short but easy, and for the price that's all you can ask for.\n73183\tSpain\tTilenus Pagos de Posada\t93\t50\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEstefania 2006 Tilenus Pagos de Posada Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tEstefania\tGT_90_Points\tRipe plum and berry aromas with a note of vanilla are highly encouraging. Hailing from a warm vintage, this 10-year-old Bierzo beauty offers a blend of pulpy ripeness with bracing acidity. Loamy plum, oak and vanilla flavors end with length and elegance.

It feels big, fresh and fruity, with racy black-cherry, chocolate and pepper flavors. Elegant, correct and complete; drink now–2016.\n36749\tSpain\tBrut\t85\t9\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tIdilicum NV Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tIdilicum\tLT_90_Points\tGreen melon and lettuce aromas are fresh and clean. The wine feels solid and good, and there's a jumble of baked apple and melon flavors. Yeasty on the finish, it's made entirely from Macabeo grapes.\n56147\tSpain\tRoca Roja\t89\t255\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarco Abella 2013 Roca Roja Garnacha (Priorat)\tGarnacha\tMarco Abella\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of burnt wood and spice cover rugged gritty berry scents. This is a tight minerally wiry Garnacha that's oaky on the palate. Oak-rich plum flavors finish with strong tannins, residual grit and lasting wood-based notes. Drink through 2022.\n64659\tSpain\tCrianza\t84\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDarien 2007 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tDarien\tLT_90_Points\tHard and tough to penetrate on the nose. The palate is crisp and a bit raw in feel, with narrow, dry plum and berry flavors. Finishes with buttery tasting oak and a crisp, acidic fade-away.\n71252\tSpain\tSuzzane\t87\t75\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOxer Basteguieta 2014 Suzzane  (Rioja)\tGarnacha\tOxer Basteguieta\tLT_90_Points\tRaisiny aromas are accompanied by a chocolate note on the nose. This Garnacha is rough and punchy on the palate, with tart currant and plum flavors that run counter to the nose. Prior to an abrasive but energetic finish, this tastes herbal and oaky.\n112139\tSpain\tVendimia Seleccionada\t87\t20\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPuertas Novas 2007 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tPuertas Novas\tLT_90_Points\tRoasted berry, marzipan, prune, spice and earth are rolled into a solid whole on the bouquet, while the palate rides on the heavy side with grating tannins and deep but clumsy flavors of blackberry, raisin and fruitcake. Smooth but not complex or demanding. Chewy and bulky, which isn't uncommon for Toro.\n3416\tSpain\tAltos de Tamaron\t83\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPagos del Rey 2014 Altos de Tamaron  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tPagos del Rey\tLT_90_Points\tCandied raspberry aromas and a racy, acidic, crisp feel tell you what's coming: pie-cherry tartness and then a sizzle-and-pop finish that's fresh but astringent.\n126671\tSpain\tFinca de Villatuerta\t84\t\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Julián Chivite 2010 Finca de Villatuerta Chardonnay (Navarra)\tChardonnay\tBodegas Julián Chivite\tLT_90_Points\tDusty apple and canned pear aromas lead to a chunky, fruity palate that tastes more briny and salty than ideal. There are leesy notes to the finish, but it's saltiness that creates the final impression.\n89380\tSpain\tTempranillo Viura\t86\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasado Morales 2011 Tempranillo Viura  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tCasado Morales\tLT_90_Points\tAromatically, this everyday wine delivers floral berry and rubbery scents. It's full and a touch gummy feeling, with creaminess and candied flavors of cassis and plum.

It smells acrid and burnt, and while the mouthfeel is fine, it tastes sulfuric and dried out, with a bitter finish. And that's not saying anything about the gold glitter flakes that float throughout this weird, pricey Cava.\n51016\tSpain\tConde de los Andes\t92\t50\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Muriel 2013 Conde de los Andes  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Muriel\tGT_90_Points\tAppealing modern-leaning aromas of root beer, berry fruits and vanilla settle with airing and turn more mellow and traditional for Rioja. Slightly plush on the palate, especially given 2013's cool nature, this is balanced despite showing raw tannins. Toasty blackened flavors of baked berry fruits, chocolate and licorice finish long, toasty and peppery. Drink through 2025–2028.\n128203\tSpain\t\t87\t12\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArmas de Guerra 2013 Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tArmas de Guerra\tLT_90_Points\tLight raspberry and plum aromas offer a touch of floral violet.

Moderate oak and a medicinal note rise up on a fresh finish.\n76327\tSpain\tReserva\t84\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBaron De Ley 2002 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBaron De Ley\tLT_90_Points\tFiery, hot aromas feature raspberry, burnt leaves, balsamic notes and earth. It's wild and jumpy in the mouth, with rhubarb and cranberry defining the tight, underdeveloped palate, while the finish is tangy and almost peachy. Shows many cool-year characteristics of a 2002.\n103667\tSpain\t\t93\t70\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPintia 2009  Toro\tTinta de Toro\tPintia\tGT_90_Points\tThere's no denying this wine's force. It's 15% ABV but balanced, with roasted berry, leather, toasty oak, graphite and prune aromas. The palate feels full, flush and without gaps, while flavors of blackberry, cassis, chocolate and spice finish exceedingly smooth, with loamy notes and leftover spice. Drink through 2020.\n82628\tSpain\tAlicena\t82\t9\tCentral Spain\tExtremadura\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Santa Marina 2005 Alicena White (Extremadura)\tWhite Blend\tViña Santa Marina\tLT_90_Points\tThe average American wine drinker is probably not interested in a three-grape white blend from hot and dry Extremadura, Spain, but in case you are, this wine is neutral on the nose and lean on the palate. Flavors of green apple, pineapple and lemon are scouring and seem designed for fried seafood.\n90551\tSpain\t\t88\t16\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLicia 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tLicia\tLT_90_Points\tApple, peach and melon aromas are fresh and easy to like. This has a pure palate, with citric and malic acidity offset by pulpy weight. Peach and apricot flavors finish long, and overall this should maintain its good shape over the next year.\n69517\tSpain\tImperial Gran Reserva\t94\t62\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCVNE 1999 Imperial Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tCVNE\tGT_90_Points\tTextbook Rioja gran reserva in every way. It's light and smoky smelling, with brown sugar, fine cologne and cedary aromas. Generous but well-cut in the mouth, with fig, mushroom, raspberry and spiced plum flavors.

It feels prune-like and saturated but not flat, with blackberry and exotic spice flavors. It qualifies as a lush, ripe specimen with a long finish that stays the course. Syrah, Cabernet and Tempranillo are the components.\n44993\tSpain\tBrut\t80\t13\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConde de Subirats NV Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tConde de Subirats\tLT_90_Points\tScattered, dusty, yeasty aromas of mustard and apple are less than welcoming.

Saturated but slightly tannic and grating in feel, this tastes of blackened toast, vanilla, blackberry and spices. Toasty black-fruit flavors are largely pure on a tannic finish. Drink through 2022.\n72155\tSpain\t\t90\t25\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPazo de Señorans 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tPazo de Señorans\tGT_90_Points\tWith a collection of apple blossom, acacia, peach and flint aromas, this fairly full-bodied Albariño offers a mix of plumpness and alluring flavors, namely nectarine, apple and white peach. Complex notes of sea brine, minerality and saline propel a sophisticated finish. Drink through summer 2016.\n16376\tSpain\tVinyes Velles\t92\t90\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTosalet 2013 Vinyes Velles Carignan (Priorat)\tCarignan\tTosalet\tGT_90_Points\tFlush aromas of raisin, blackberry and cassis are ripe through and through. This wine feels tight, with tannic scrape. Spicy, reedy flavors of red plum and berry fruits are textbook for Carignan, while mixed black fruits and fig show on a chocolaty finish. Best from 2020–2025.\n120088\tSpain\t\t94\t40\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio de Atauta 2014  Ribera del Duero\tTinto Fino\tDominio de Atauta\tGT_90_Points\tA pretty nose shows violet notes alongside leather, blackberry and cassis aromas. The palate is full and edgy, with rubbery tannins that could use some years to resolve. A roasted, beefy flavor profile includes nuances of smoked meat that make this about more than just black fruit. Drink through 2028.\n19922\tSpain\tSoplo\t89\t16\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Rafael Cambra 2010 Soplo Garnacha (Valencia)\tGarnacha\tBodegas Rafael Cambra\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a clean, fresh style of Garnacha with floral black cherry aromas offset by a minty note. The palate has a zingy feel and crisp, fresh plum, raspberry and dry herb flavors. As a whole it's focused and uncomplicated; this is very good Garnacha from one of the Valencia region's better producers.\n109358\tSpain\tReserva\t85\t9\tLevante\tValencia\t\t\t\tCastillo Catadau 1996 Reserva Red (Valencia)\tTempranillo Blend\tCastillo Catadau\tLT_90_Points\tTasty in a tart way, with licorice hints, this well-balanced, medium-weight red shows plenty of herb-tinged, sour cherry flavor. Good acidity and moderate tannins make this a good match for grilled veal. Think Claret, but from southern Spain. Drink now–2004. Best Buy. —M.M.\n18476\tSpain\t\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGranate 2008 Garnacha (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha\tGranate\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of sweet black cherry and dark plum form a good bouquet.

At this price, finding a good Ribera wine is akin to the proverbial needle in the haystack; so seek out this meaty, ripe number and dig into its plum and berry body that's backed by vanilla, coconut and good tannic structure.\n97487\tSpain\t\t88\t17\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNessa 2012 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tNessa\tLT_90_Points\tMinerally, oceanic aromas of sea shell, apple and nectarine are focused and fresh. In the mouth, this is easygoing and a bit plump, with good acidity pushing peach, citrus and apple flavors. A pithy finish with hints of almond skin is mildly bitter and tight.\n61349\tSpain\t\t83\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Tomares 2011  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo\tMarques de Tomares\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of blueberry, violet and berry fruits come with a strong hint of alfalfa and sweet grass.

The nose delivers still-fresh apple and mineral aromas, while the flavor profile leans toward gooseberry, lemon and green melon. Shows some pithy bitterness on the finish, so drink right away or seek out the '09.\n55938\tSpain\tNaiades\t91\t29\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNaia 2008 Naiades Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tNaia\tGT_90_Points\tSmoky, toasty and without a doubt barrel fermented. This feels a little raw and tannic for a white wine, but it's also grippy, elevated and fruity. On the palate, things open with a blast of apple and raw oak; the finish is long and tastes of butterscotch and dried apple. A classy wine from some of the oldest vines in Rueda.\n109295\tSpain\tKortezubi Urdaibai\t86\t22\tNorthern Spain\tBizkaiko Txakolina\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarko 2011 Kortezubi Urdaibai Hondarrabi Zuri (Bizkaiko Txakolina)\tHondarrabi Zuri\tMarko\tLT_90_Points\tDespite being fairly young, this is a weighty wine with a gold color and waxy apple aromas. A blocky mouthfeel is oily and has enough acidity to stay lively. Flavors of chunky apple, peach and melon lead to a round, oily feeling finish.\n98939\tSpain\t\t85\t32\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSplendore 2007  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo\tSplendore\tLT_90_Points\tDry on the nose, with balsam shavings, pepper and secondary red fruit aromas.

A gritty palate with full tannins scrapes at your cheeks, while plum and cherry flavors are loud at first then fade away on a raisiny, sweet finish. Tasted twice, this note reflects both tastings.\n128601\tSpain\t\t85\t18\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Albret 2015 Garnacha (Navarra)\tGarnacha\tFinca Albret\tLT_90_Points\tFlat, earthy raisin and prune aromas in this Garnacha indicate very ripe, almost desiccated fruit.

There's a light spritz to the palate, then bland, salty flavors take over. It offers a hint of citrus on the finish but mostly brine and salt.\n76371\tSpain\t\t86\t12\tCatalonia\tTerra Alta\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLas Colinas Del Ebro 2011 Garnacha Blanca (Terra Alta)\tGarnacha Blanca\tLas Colinas Del Ebro\tLT_90_Points\tSimple apple, peach and citrus aromas form a mild opening that sets the stage for what amounts to an easygoing, fresh wine with white-fruit flavors of peach and nectarine.

It feels zesty, spritzy and citric, then tastes almost entirely of orange and tangerine, with a dry finish.\n127255\tSpain\tLaudum Nature Oak Aged Made With Organic Grapes\t87\t13\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBocopa 2014 Laudum Nature Oak Aged Made With Organic Grapes Red (Alicante)\tRed Blend\tBocopa\tLT_90_Points\tLightly horsey, leathery aromas of black fruits come with a heavy oak component. This is tight and tannic, with dark, woody black-plum flavors that are highly permeable to oak character. A grabby finish is short and hard.\n3935\tSpain\tRosado\t83\t14\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOchoa 2010 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra)\tGarnacha\tOchoa\tLT_90_Points\tSalmon colored, with somewhat flat aromas of peach and sweet melon. Sweet on the palate, with weight and thickness along with cantaloupe and a candied aftertaste. Finishes chunky and flat; tasted twice with inconsistent findings. This note reflects the better bottle.\n73215\tSpain\tRoble\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPríncipe de Viana 2012 Roble Tempranillo (Navarra)\tTempranillo\tPríncipe de Viana\tLT_90_Points\tCrisp, snappy red-berry aromas are the opening on this fresh and easy Tempranillo.

Chunky blackberry flavors mix with earth and saline notes, while the finish is full and easy, with mild tannins. Drink through 2018.\n72054\tSpain\tLanius\t87\t35\tCatalonia\tAlella\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlta Alella 2013 Lanius White (Alella)\tWhite Blend\tAlta Alella\tLT_90_Points\tWaxy, cheesy, resiny aromas rest heavily atop baked apple and vanilla scents. This is round and easy, maybe even soft, with flavors of toasty oak, vanilla extract, mixed nuts and wood grain. As a whole, the wine is very much oak-driven.\n33727\tSpain\t\t86\t23\tNorthern Spain\tValdeorras\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasal Novo 2011 Godello (Valdeorras)\tGodello\tCasal Novo\tLT_90_Points\tSweet melon, peach and vanilla aromas come with a tropical leaning. The mouthfeel trends toward flat, while modest flavors of apple and melon are supported by soft, melony acidity. While this is good, it's on the flat and flabby side.\n39145\tSpain\tDos\t89\t30\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRafael Cambra 2012 Dos Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc (Valencia)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc\tRafael Cambra\tLT_90_Points\tRipe raisin, berry and horsey aromas are solid, not flabby. A lifted, juicy palate is healthy and fresh, while mild medicinal notes are infused into a red-berry flavor profile. On the finish, oak spice and medicinality linger amid acid-driven length.\n8774\tSpain\tNorte\t89\t95\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPujanza 2010 Norte  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tPujanza\tLT_90_Points\tPowdery, perfumed aromas of raspberry and red plum announce a palate with ringing acidity. Plum, red currant and strawberry flavors come with moderate loamy weight, while the finish takes on an earthy quality that's balanced by shearing, tangy acidity. This is only 60% Tempranillo while the rest is Garnacha, Graciano and Mazuelo. Drink through 2020.\n122405\tSpain\tRoble\t84\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTrus 2014 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tTrus\tLT_90_Points\tScattered and unruly up front, this smells downright foxy. The palate is both narrow and sharp, while flavors of vanilla oak, soupy black fruits and tart acidity come around a bit on the finish.\n3312\tSpain\tReserva Raventós Brut\t87\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCodorníu NV Reserva Raventós Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tCodorníu\tLT_90_Points\tGinger ale and Sprite are the first things that come to mind when you give it a sniff. The palate shows ripe and sweet orange, tangerine and pink grapefruit, while the back end is lean and citrusy but far short of complex. Good in a standard way.\n53118\tSpain\tBlanco\t89\t80\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRemelluri 2013 Blanco White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tRemelluri\tLT_90_Points\tA mature nose of cornbread and oxidized fruits suggests a wine older than this. A white blend, it features a multitude of grapes led by Viura. On the palate, acidity is the key ingredient, while a mix of oxidized apple, melon and corn flavors runs long on the finish. Drink through 2022.\n43381\tSpain\tMas D'Aranyó Riserva\t83\t15\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\t\t\tSegura Viudas 1997 Mas D'Aranyó Riserva Tempranillo (Penedès)\tTempranillo\tSegura Viudas\tLT_90_Points\tShows some nice red berry fruit with tobacco and white pepper accents, but a negative note between green pepper and sour cream distracts and detracts considerably. A tasty wine with nice feel and decent length upon opening, it disappointingly goes downhill as the off-putting element ascends. —M.M.\n17871\tSpain\tOld Vines\t88\t16\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tQuo 2011 Old Vines Grenache (Campo de Borja)\tGrenache\tQuo\tLT_90_Points\tConcentrated on the nose, with oak aromas that are under control, this Garnacha is fresh and firm on the palate. Flavors of loamy berry and cassis are ripe almost to the point of being raisiny. A plump yet dry and spicy finish ends with oak-based resin and creaminess.\n47012\tSpain\t\t88\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuga 2011 Rosé (Rioja)\tRosé\tMuga\tLT_90_Points\tThis is very light in color, with lightweight aromas of peach and citrus. It feels crisp and angular, with fine acidity that creates supreme freshness on the tongue. Flavors of peach and nectarine are spunky, ending like the toot of a whistle.\n91899\tSpain\tCapr icho\t86\t28\tNorthern Spain\tCigales\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Legua 2013 Capr icho Tempranillo (Cigales)\tTempranillo\tLa Legua\tLT_90_Points\tBaked black-fruit aromas feature a ton of oak and related char and spice. In the mouth, this is pulling, blocky, tannic and wiry. A mixed bag of oak, spice, clove and blackberry flavors finishes like a campfire, with choppy, hard tannins that make for a rock-hard closing mouthfeel.\n57655\tSpain\tParaje Tornel\t87\t11\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio de la Vega 2012 Paraje Tornel Bobal (Utiel-Requena)\tBobal\tDominio de la Vega\tLT_90_Points\tPlump soft aromas of berry fruits, raisin and prune hint at ripeness. This feels dense and chewy, with integrated tannins. Saucy savory berry and plum flavors suggest tomato sauce, while this tastes lightly oaky and minty on the finish.\n93195\tSpain\tColección Vivanco Parcelas de\t86\t120\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDinastía Vivanco 2008 Colección Vivanco Parcelas de  (Rioja)\tGraciano\tDinastía Vivanco\tLT_90_Points\tBalsamic aromas are matched by high-toned blueberry and cherry scents as well as vanilla and brandy. This feels wiry and bouncy, which is normal for acid-driven Graciano. Flavors of oak, toast and wild berry are so juicy and acidic that the finish is tangy.\n91240\tSpain\tBlanco\t85\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOstatu 2014 Blanco White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tOstatu\tLT_90_Points\tThis blend of Viura and Malvasia is mild, low on aromatic punch and suggestive of saline solution. This is friendly but flat in feel, with modest structure. Leesy flavors of peach and apple finish chalky and grabby.\n2759\tSpain\tCuvée KPF\t84\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMontebuena 2014 Cuvée KPF  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMontebuena\tLT_90_Points\tThis light-bodied Rioja smells of cherry, plum and cotton candy. It's a bit thin on the palate but offers just enough body to be worthwhile. Mild plum and cherry flavors hollow out on the simple finish.\n109983\tSpain\tPeza do Rei\t89\t20\tGalicia\tRibeira Sacra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAdega Cachín 2015 Peza do Rei Mencía (Ribeira Sacra)\tMencía\tAdega Cachín\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine's floral, lightly jammy red berry aromas smell like nice bath soap. It's tight and raw on the palate, expanding a bit with air. Its mix of red fruit and herbal flavors is linear and lively, although the finish is slightly abrasive.\n69270\tSpain\t\t88\t20\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArtadi 2014 Garnacha Blanca (Navarra)\tGarnacha Blanca\tArtadi\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of gasoline and white grapefruit skins lead to tangy palate with good grip and weight. This tastes waxy, bitter and citrusy, with a hint of tropical fruit. Zesty acidity livens up the finish, which runs fairly long.\n14440\tSpain\tCoster de l'Ermita\t91\t105\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMas Igneus 2006 Coster de l'Ermita Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tMas Igneus\tGT_90_Points\tThis is classic Priorat from the opening gun. The nose is schisty on top, with molasses, spice, herb and stewed berry aromas below the surface. It's a spunky, racy wine with flavors of tomato, red plum, hard spice, pepper and tobacco, and the finish feels good and shows no detectable faults. Drink now; 80% Garnacha and 20% Carignan.\n87483\tSpain\tInspiración Valdemar\t85\t95\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Valdemar 2005 Inspiración Valdemar  (Rioja)\tGraciano\tBodegas Valdemar\tLT_90_Points\tIntense and frisky, with mild green-herbal aromas standing out on the nose. Like any varietal Graciano, the wine is shrill, with acidity pushing the tart side of the huckleberry and blueberry fruit. Lean at the end, with little richness. Best for die-hard Rioja buffs and fans of acidic red wines.\n99465\tSpain\tPrivat Brut Nature\t89\t25\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlta Alella 2013 Privat Brut Nature Chardonnay (Cava)\tChardonnay\tAlta Alella\tLT_90_Points\tBriny apple and lime aromas set up a minerally, fresh, natural palate with stony lime, green apple and white-pineapple flavors. Par for the brut nature course is a stony, chiseled finish that frames the wine's crisp, lean character.\n111075\tSpain\t\t87\t20\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConcertum 2010 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tConcertum\tLT_90_Points\tSaline and oceanic on the bouquet, but largely it's neutral-smelling. Feels tight and fresh, but tastes a bit stalky and bitter, with baked apple and a strong taste of straw. Finishes with white pepper notes and that same stalky flavor from before.\n87000\tSpain\tRomanico\t89\t14\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTeso La Monja 2014 Romanico  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tTeso La Monja\tLT_90_Points\tDespite showing reduced black plum and blackberry aromas, this displays grippy tannins and tension on the palate. Its blackberry and boysenberry flavors are lush, and the oak is mild and integrated on the finish.\n79970\tSpain\tTxakolina\t83\t19\tSpain Other\tSpain\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBeldui 2011 Txakolina White (Spain)\tWhite Blend\tBeldui\tLT_90_Points\tAn oily popcorn aroma is neither fresh nor lively. The palate is wide and mouthfilling, with notes of bitter almond and creamy citrus. It's viscous on the finish, but there's not much flavor or character.\n92966\tSpain\tTros de Clos\t93\t99\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPortal del Priorat 2014 Tros de Clos Carignan (Priorat)\tCarignan\tPortal del Priorat\tGT_90_Points\tThis purple-tinted Carignan is a concentrated number with familiar varietal and regional aromas of latex, graphite, schist, tire rubber and black fruits. In the mouth, this is chewy and full bodied, but not heavy. Oaky spicy blackberry and nutmeg flavors linger on a mildly woody, extracted and gritty finish. Best to give this a few more years so drink through 2022.\n49952\tSpain\tAAA\t93\t250\tCentral Spain\tDominio de Valdepusa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Griñon 2010 AAA Red (Dominio de Valdepusa)\tRed Blend\tMarques de Griñon\tGT_90_Points\tThis black-colored, opaque bruiser is as concentrated as wine gets before crossing the line. Aromas of gritty black fruits are amped up, while the palate pounds with extraction and tannins. Huge flavors of blackberry and cassis finish with more muscle than finesse. This is ultra ripe Graciano and Petit Verdot that nobody would describe as shy. Drink through 2020.\n29930\tSpain\tOcho y Media\t85\t9\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca La Estacada 2015 Ocho y Media Tinto Velasco (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTinto Velasco\tFinca La Estacada\tLT_90_Points\tA fruit-forward nose with earthy plum and berry aromas leads to a sharp, lively palate with high acidity. Plum and berry flavors are rendered angular by said acidity, while mild salty notes rise up on the finish.\n79720\tSpain\tTorre Muga\t96\t101\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuga 2011 Torre Muga  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMuga\tGT_90_Points\tConcentrated, ripe and pure on the nose, this is toasty smelling and intense, with notes of charcoal, cassis and blackberry. A grabby, extracted but balanced and impressive palate holds flavors of coffee, toasty oak, bitter chocolate and wild berries. The finish tastes savory and fully oaked, but not overdone. Hold a few years, then drink through 2026.\n93514\tSpain\t\t88\t22\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tA2O 2006 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tA2O\tLT_90_Points\tA solid wine with mineral, white pepper and waxy fruit aromas. The palate is ripe and bulky, but also acidic enough to be balanced and stylish. Pineapple is the forceful flavor, while the finish is full and slightly oily. Drink this fruity, bigger-framed Albariño now.\n3885\tSpain\t\t86\t12\tCatalonia\tTerra Alta\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLas Colinas Del Ebro 2008 Syrah-Grenache (Terra Alta)\tSyrah-Grenache\tLas Colinas Del Ebro\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous. The palate is well balanced and the flavors run sweet, ripe and chewy, with berry fruit and creamy licorice notes on the finish. A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Garnacha from Catalonia.\n48605\tSpain\t\t84\t11\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMureda 2014 Chardonnay (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tChardonnay\tMureda\tLT_90_Points\tWhite-fruit aromas of pear, apple and melon are decent. This feels round but not exact. Chunky flavors of apple and melon are low on zest and freshness, while the finish feels heavy and is salty in taste.\n51240\tSpain\t\t83\t14\tCentral Spain\tCastilla La Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tChapter Capítulo 8 2012 Sauvignon Blanc-Verdejo (Castilla La Mancha)\tSauvignon Blanc-Verdejo\tChapter Capítulo 8\tLT_90_Points\tPunchy grapefruit aromas come with a touch of minerality. An oily yet spritzy feeling palate doesn't score many points, while the flavor profile is bitterness offset by pithy citrus flavors.\n60701\tSpain\t\t89\t25\tNorthern Spain\tGetariako Txakolina\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTxomín Etxaníz 2014 Hondarrabi Zuri (Getariako Txakolina)\tHondarrabi Zuri\tTxomín Etxaníz\tLT_90_Points\tPapaya and stone-fruit aromas are fleshy and a touch green and grassy, giving way to dustiness upon airing. This feels spritzy and good, with a full complement of golden apple, white grape and green plum flavors. Solid, stony and minerally on the finish, with a hint of tropical fruit flavor.\n107977\tSpain\tDehesa Gago\t88\t18\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodríguez 2009 Dehesa Gago  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tTelmo Rodríguez\tLT_90_Points\tMuscular plum and black cherry aromas come with citrus peel and herbal notes. The mouthfeel is stout and healthy, with chewy tannins and lightly baked flavors of sweet blackberry darkened by pepper. Jammy and ripe overall; good Toro for under $20.\n72007\tSpain\tCrianza\t87\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConde Bel 2011 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tConde Bel\tLT_90_Points\tMinty, earthy aromas suggest Christmas spice and fruit cake. This is saturated but a bit soupy and drying. Flavors of prune, plum, raisin and spices are a touch stewed, while this finishes ripe but short on freshness.\n56949\tSpain\tNana\t81\t32\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAttis 2013 Nana Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tAttis\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of Sherry and barrel resin are all you get from this wood-fermented, oxidized number. While neither foul nor severe, the all-wood nature of this is overly dominant and not pleasant enough to stand on its own.\n71883\tSpain\tOld Vine\t85\t12\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRed Guitar 2006 Old Vine Tempranillo-Garnacha (Navarra)\tTempranillo-Garnacha\tRed Guitar\tLT_90_Points\tA little spice and cured meat (salami) get this young and easy red going. The blend is common for Navarra, and this is a jammy, mildly candied wine with light strawberry and plum flavors touched up by a dollop of sweetness. Slightly creamy on the palate and finish, but healthy as a whole.\n80268\tSpain\tCentenaria\t83\t15\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCoto de Hayas 2015 Centenaria Garnacha (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha\tCoto de Hayas\tLT_90_Points\tThis heavily oaked Garnacha smells like clove and horsehide. A drawing, scratchy, resiny palate offers clove and barrel-spice flavors. The wine feels tannic and rubbing on a finish that tastes exclusively of oak-based clove.\n43288\tSpain\tThe Thinker\t84\t13\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Pensador 2010 The Thinker Garnacha (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha\tEl Pensador\tLT_90_Points\tWith slightly sharp, herbal red-fruit aromas, this representes the lighter side of Garnacha. In the mouth, it's choppy but fresh, while leafy flavors of plum, raspberry and peppery spice finish fiery and dry.\n77767\tSpain\t\t86\t17\tNorthern Spain\tValdeorras\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPagos del Galir 2012 Godello (Valdeorras)\tGodello\tPagos del Galir\tLT_90_Points\tApple, lettuce and celery aromas are a bit hard and green. This is plump and solid in feel, with orange, grapefruit and generic minerality. A citrusy finish confirms the wine's fruity status.\n92447\tSpain\tRosado\t80\t15\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEstancia Piedra 2007 Rosado Rosé (Toro)\tRosé\tEstancia Piedra\tLT_90_Points\tThis is two consecutive vintages of sketchy to poor rosé from this label.

Melon and papaya flavors are fair, while the finish is clean but light. This Verdejo-SB blend is a straightforward quaffer.\n5401\tSpain\tCortijo de Balsillas\t85\t\tAndalucia\tVino de la Tierra Altiplano de Sierra Nevada\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVillagrán 2007 Cortijo de Balsillas Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra Altiplano de Sierra Nevada)\tTempranillo\tVillagrán\tLT_90_Points\tMature berry aromas carry a strong sidenote of raisin. This Tempranillo from the Granada area is tightly wound, with crisp, dry flavors of prune, vanilla and raw oak. Overall this seems a bit cooked and past its prime.\n4532\tSpain\tRosado\t82\t11\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Albret 2011 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra)\tGarnacha\tFinca Albret\tLT_90_Points\tThis barrel-fermented rosé is flat and smells more like apple juice than wine. Despite showing some tang, this is dull in the mouth, with bland orange and nectarine flavors. On the finish, it's washed out and has an iodine-like aftertaste.\n76343\tSpain\t\t88\t18\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMedulas 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo (Valencia)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo\tMedulas\tLT_90_Points\tBerry aromas and a hint of warmth are the greeting on this blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Tempranillo. The mouthfeel is full, while the body is chunky, with adequate structure. Flavors of black fruits come with a touch of toast, and the finish is round in feel and friendly in flavor.\n70229\tSpain\tGazur\t88\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodríguez 2012 Gazur  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tTelmo Rodríguez\tLT_90_Points\tPlum, raspberry and animal fur aromas settle with airing. Rubbery, grabby tannins create a hard-as-rocks mouthfeel, while blackberry and cassis flavors turn toasty on the finish. This is hard on the palate straight up; holding through 2016 can only help.\n32296\tSpain\tEstate Bottled\t88\t45\tCentral Spain\tDominio de Valdepusa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Griñon 2003 Estate Bottled Syrah (Dominio de Valdepusa)\tSyrah\tMarques de Griñon\tLT_90_Points\tDark as night, with forceful aromas of root beer, menthol, warm earth and baked fruits. Maybe it's a bit soft and widespread given the heat of 2003, but if flesh and fruit turn you on and the lack of complexity isn't too disconcerting, it's a fine modern Syrah. Good with bacon burgers, steak off the grill, etc.\n95650\tSpain\tCap de Trons\t86\t30\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFerré I Catasús 2012 Cap de Trons Red (Penedès)\tRed Blend\tFerré I Catasús\tLT_90_Points\tFeral aromas of leather, Middle Eastern spices and roasted berry fruits give way to a chunky, tannic yet somewhat flat palate.

A spunky, citric mouthfeel is tight and exact. Nothing beyond citrus flavors are present on a cutting palate. Echoes of lime propel the finish.\n19097\tSpain\t\t87\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPalma Real 2015 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tPalma Real\tLT_90_Points\tCrisp aromas of celery and lime set up a fresh citrusy palate that's light to medium in both body and weight. Flavors of green-grape skins and lemon-lime finish a bit salty, but with proper acidity and balance.\n53467\tSpain\tGlorioso Crianza\t87\t19\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Palacio 2010 Glorioso Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Palacio\tLT_90_Points\tPlum and berry aromas are clean but regular. The wine feels wiry and bouncy, with pointed acidity. Fresh, tangy flavors of red berry and cranberry finish dry, oaky and tight. It's good and familiar in an old-school way.\n63721\tSpain\tRosa Nautica\t88\t19\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Gitana 2014 Rosa Nautica Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tLa Gitana\tLT_90_Points\tApple and stone-fruit aromas are a little oily and starting to fade. Driving acidity keeps this in forward mode, but there's an empty gap in the middle of the palate. Waxy apple, apricot and orange flavors finish just juicy enough. Drink immediately.\n62596\tSpain\t\t86\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPenelope Sanchez 2014 Red (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha Blend\tPenelope Sanchez\tLT_90_Points\tHeavy oak aromas rest forcefully on top of plum and black cherry scents.

It tastes of citrus and lees, and the finish is medium in length and healthy.\n7699\tSpain\tViña Sanzo\t86\t9\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValsanzo 2005 Viña Sanzo Tempranillo (Rueda)\tTempranillo\tValsanzo\tLT_90_Points\tFor a basic Tempranillo from Rueda, there's nothing not to like about this wine. It's snappy and fresh, maybe a bit sharp, but not spiky. The flavors are of berry and cherry, and the feel is tight but solid, with some juicy depth. Drink it like you might Beaujolais.\n60681\tSpain\tMM Reserva de la Familia Brut Rosé\t86\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de la Concordia 2012 MM Reserva de la Familia Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMarqués de la Concordia\tLT_90_Points\tThis round yet direct Cava offers stone-fruit aromas that are upright and clean.

The palate is both jammy and tannic, while flavors of plum and boysenberry turn raisiny as it breathes. A thick, loamy finish tastes baked and jammy, with brawny tannins. This may benefit from more time in bottle.\n46496\tSpain\t\t86\t12\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSerra da Estrela 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tSerra da Estrela\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of bath soap, ham, yeast and white flowers lead to a tangy, narrow palate.

The palate is clean and tangy, with strawberry, raspberry and citrusy flavors. Freshness is this wine's middle name. It's old-school, so don't look for a lot of color, body or sweetness.\n39901\tSpain\tBrut Reserva\t87\t10\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSegura Viudas NV Brut Reserva Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tSegura Viudas\tLT_90_Points\tWhite fruits and candied apple aromas turn a little dusty with airing.

This is chunky, jammy and fairly concentrated in the mouth, with blackberry and cocoa notes. A loamy, plump finish is friendly and offers plenty of weight and density.\n124802\tSpain\tRoble\t88\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Arnáiz 2009 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tViña Arnáiz\tLT_90_Points\tWith dark aromas of prune, black tea and baked earth, this is a ripe, modern wine with sound balance and depth of flavor. It deals a nice mix of fresh berry fruit flavors blended with oak, while the finish rings on with spice, mint and proper acidity.\n52362\tSpain\tM Marrugat Gran Reserva Brut Nature Millésime\t88\t24\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPinord 2009 M Marrugat Gran Reserva Brut Nature Millésime Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tPinord\tLT_90_Points\tNeutral white-fruit aromas turn cheesy with airing. This vintage Brut Nature feels rather flat and lifeless, while a mix of buttery, bitter flavors suggest quince and butterscotch. Nutty notes and almondy bitterness control the finish. Drink now.\n127828\tSpain\tVendimia Seleccionada\t89\t32\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tResalte 2011 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tResalte\tLT_90_Points\tSpiced berry, dry oak and a note of latex define the nose on this ripe, likable, friendly Tempranillo. The wine is lively on the palate, with candied, jumpy flavors of berry fruits that finish with some foxiness and a wet-fur note. The emphasis here is on fresh fruit more than power or oakiness.\n108993\tSpain\t\t88\t24\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPittacum 2010 Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tPittacum\tLT_90_Points\tReduced, foxy berry aromas come with a rubbery note of latex. The palate is full and chunky, with moderate flabby weight. Black-fruit and peppery flavors end in loamy, toasty, jammy fashion, so drink this full-bodied Mencía now.\n19766\tSpain\tSelección Especial\t91\t35\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Sobreño 2010 Selección Especial  (Toro)\tTinta del Toro\tFinca Sobreño\tGT_90_Points\tAromas of beef jerky, oak and black fruits are integrated and attractive. This feels both plush and tannic, while ripe blackberry, cassis, toast, chocolate and spice flavors end long and with good depth and complexity. Drink this ripe but balanced Toro through 2027.\n16233\tSpain\t\t87\t18\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFerrum 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tFerrum\tLT_90_Points\tAromas include dry apricot and papaya with a hint of cider. This is on the soft side in feel, with dilution along with apple-based acidity. Flavors of nectarine and peach finish monotone. Drink immediately or wait for a fresher 2012 version.\n28554\tSpain\tVertus Crianza\t82\t15\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Iranzo 2004 Vertus Crianza Tempranillo (Utiel-Requena)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Iranzo\tLT_90_Points\tA lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.\n79232\tSpain\tReserva\t87\t35\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSolar de Libano 2008 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tSolar de Libano\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of tobacco, vanilla and dried fruit take on a grassy note after airing in the glass. A cool, wet vintage for the region yields a slightly astringent and acidic palate. Flavors of dried plum, cherry and vanilla carry a tart streak, while the finish is both earthy and a bit sour.\n64756\tSpain\tMPX Brut Rosé\t89\t11\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMas de Monistrol NV MPX Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMas de Monistrol\tLT_90_Points\tMas de Monistrol always seems to please. This rosado is dusty and smoky on the nose, with lightly roasted fruit aromas peeking through. The flavors are more in the cherry and cranberry field, so in terms of mouthfeel it leans toward tangy, racy and pulsing. And who would want it any other way?\n72396\tSpain\tAlbero Bobal\t85\t6\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tIranzo Fields 2009 Albero Bobal Rosé (Utiel-Requena)\tRosé\tIranzo Fields\tLT_90_Points\tAlmost red in color, with dusty aromas that mix in a blast of latex and dried cherry notes. The wine is made from organically grown Bobal grapes, and it offers tang and bite along with crisp flavors of plum skins, raspberry and citrus. Almost sour, but not. A solid quaffer for the price.\n30778\tSpain\tLegus\t86\t13\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodega La Serrana 2007 Legus Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tBodega La Serrana\tLT_90_Points\tSolid Mencía, but a little on the generic, bland side. The body is medium, the tannins mellow, and the flavors are your standard dark berry. The finish is easygoing but doesn't offer much pizzazz or lasting impressions. Fresh, no-nonsense Bierzo for everyday drinking.\n88092\tSpain\t\t83\t10\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa Solar 2011 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo\tCasa Solar\tLT_90_Points\tRed-fruit aromas lead the charge, but they come with a green, candied component. This is flabby in feel, with minty berry flavors and a modest finish.\n36839\tSpain\tAlmendros\t89\t40\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAngosto 2013 Almendros Red (Valencia)\tRed Blend\tAngosto\tLT_90_Points\tThis blend of Garnacha, Marsellan and Syrah opens with a dark, inky, smoky nose that's full of lemony oak along with black-fruit aromas. It's hard as nails on the palate, with drilling tannins. Rubbery, herbal blackberry flavors end with burnt toast, rubbery accents and a briny aftertaste. Best from 2017–2022.\n73933\tSpain\tPropiedad\t88\t50\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPalacios Remondo 2012 Propiedad  (Rioja)\tGarnacha\tPalacios Remondo\tLT_90_Points\tThis Rioja Baja Garnacha is earthy on the nose, with aromas of stewed berry fruits, tomato and raisin. The palate is livelier than the aromas, but this still feels a bit heavy and stewed. Flavors of vanilla, root beer and saucy berry fruits lack pop on a finish that seems to be tiring.\n30076\tSpain\t\t85\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSeñorio de Uñuela 2010  Rioja\tTempranillo\tSeñorio de Uñuela\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose is big and rubbery, with aromas of bacon, tar and black plum. It feels young and choppy, with a lightly herbal berry flavor that turns more roasted in character as the wine opens. This gets the job done despite showing a roasted flavor throughout.\n21016\tSpain\t\t84\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRios de Tinta 2015  Ribera del Duero\tTinto Fino\tRios de Tinta\tLT_90_Points\tThis rustic, herbal Tinto Fino has tarry blackberry and cassis aromas that turn horsey, minty and herbal on a nose that struggles to hold up. After hinting at savory berries, flavors turn green, bitter and underripe. It finishes with rough tannins and heat.\n82888\tSpain\tCrianza\t85\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Legarda 2008 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarqués de Legarda\tLT_90_Points\tRaspberry, chocolate and plum aromas form a basic bouquet. This shows tight grip along with flavors of baked berry fruits, leather and earth. The finish tastes a bit rubbery, and then heat and dry, peppery notes take over.\n30877\tSpain\tJaloco\t82\t30\tCentral Spain\tExtremadura\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Medina 2005 Jaloco Red (Extremadura)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Medina\tLT_90_Points\tThis is one unusual wine. It's a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with Tempranillo and Garnacha, but it smells like a root-based perfume mixed with herbs and tobacco. It's over the hill in feel and green and herbal in flavor, with a raisiny aftertaste.\n122557\tSpain\tCirsion\t97\t250\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Roda 2009 Cirsion  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Roda\tGT_90_Points\tSolid as a battleship, with lemony oak, marzipan and layer upon layer of black fruit aromas. Almost syrupy in its richness but not fully; it's chewy and creamy, with vital acids. The flavors are mega ripe and rich, emphasizing blackberry, black cherry preserves, fudge and fig paste. Yet at the same time it's an ethereal wine; the epitome of modern Rioja. Drink now through 2015.\n110374\tSpain\t\t89\t32\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTionio 2013  Ribera del Duero\tTinto Fino\tTionio\tLT_90_Points\tRacy berry aromas come with a hint of oaky cinnamon. This feels raw, tannic and dense. Flavors of roasted plum, dry oak, savory spices and grilled meat finish firm and taste toasty. Drink through 2022.\n116220\tSpain\tAsuncion Oloroso - 500 ml\t90\t29\tAndalucia\tMontilla-Moriles\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlvear NV Asuncion Oloroso - 500 ml Pedro Ximénez (Montilla-Moriles)\tPedro Ximénez\tAlvear\tGT_90_Points\tStarts out closed and dense, but with airing it hits its stride. The palate is full and chunky, with creamy, sweet flavors of honey, toffee and nuts. Shows fine texture and acidity, with toast, raisin, fig and date notes on the finish. While this may be a \"dry styled\" wine from Andalusia, it's more rich than dry.\n90628\tSpain\tVivanco Tempranillo-Garnacha\t83\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDinastía Vivanco 2011 Vivanco Tempranillo-Garnacha Rosé (Rioja)\tRosé\tDinastía Vivanco\tLT_90_Points\tWith its day-glo pink color, this smells stalky and lacks the aromatic freshness one seeks in rosé. The mouthfeel is reasonably lively and grabby, with briny, pickled citrus flavors in front of a briny tasting finish.\n48905\tSpain\tDalmau\t95\t165\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Murrieta 2004 Dalmau  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarqués de Murrieta\tGT_90_Points\tDalmau, the ultrapremium Tempranillo blend from Marques de Murrieta, is 65% pricier in 2004 than '03. And that might be justified. This is a spectacular wine in every sense of the word. The nose blends alluring scents of smoke, asphalt, rubber and black fruit. The palate is saturated and smooth, with black cherry and blackberry flavors leading the way. Coffee, berry pie and mocha help the finish hold court and then fade away. Already good but best from 2010–2020.\n61336\tSpain\tLicenciado Reserva\t88\t50\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBurgo Viejo 2011 Licenciado Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBurgo Viejo\tLT_90_Points\tSoupy heavy aromas suggest that the sun-baked conditions of 2011 got the better of this wine. In the mouth, this feels jammy and thick, with a shortage of balance and elegance. This tastes stewy, with meaty berry flavors and licorice notes. A heavy finish confirms a sense of overripeness.\n45261\tSpain\tConde de Valdemar Reserva\t89\t26\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Valdemar 2010 Conde de Valdemar Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Valdemar\tLT_90_Points\tBriary, oaky, stalky berry aromas lead to a full-bodied palate with tomatoey acidity.

It's a thin-sided, tangy sort of wine with as much citrus as there is berry fruit. For something aged and mild, it's pretty good but not what you'd call substantial. Imported by Luneau USA Inc.\n86324\tSpain\t3\t88\t19\tAndalucia\tVino de la Tierra Altiplano de Sierra Nevada\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVertijana 2008 3 Red (Vino de la Tierra Altiplano de Sierra Nevada)\tRed Blend\tVertijana\tLT_90_Points\tThis Tempranillo-led blend from southern Spain opens with a lot of oak on top of mature berry and graphite aromas.

A medium-bodied palate is centered on tight racy acidity, while this blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon tastes of red plum, mixed spices and cocoa powder. An edgy finish with spiced cherry and plum flavors is juicy and primed by raw acidity.\n26056\tSpain\tPrados Fusión\t84\t12\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPagos del Moncayo 2015 Prados Fusión Garnacha-Syrah (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha-Syrah\tPagos del Moncayo\tLT_90_Points\tHeavy, grapy aromas are topped with forceful oak.

Simply put: it's a leafy, muddled Ribera wine.\n2534\tSpain\tCrianza\t89\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTrus 2012 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinta Fina\tTrus\tLT_90_Points\tGritty, lightly stalky aromas of herbal blackberry smell a bit roasted and/or burnt. This is medium-full in body, with drying tannins. Roasted, tarry plum and berry flavors finish with peppery spice and heat.\n124589\tSpain\tViña Pilar Roble\t83\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFelix Callejo 2008 Viña Pilar Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tFelix Callejo\tLT_90_Points\tCherry and mild sawdust aromas are brought down by sharpness that is almost vinegar-like. The palate has an acceptable mouthfeel along with sweet and sour flavors of plum and berry. Tart on the finish, and a bit stemmy and sharp throughout.\n123902\tSpain\tParada de Atauta\t91\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio de Atauta 2012 Parada de Atauta  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tDominio de Atauta\tGT_90_Points\tSophisticated aromas of blackberry, dried cherry, shoe polish and crushed leaves set up a grabby palate with ripe, bullish tannins. This wine offers black-fruit flavors along with spice, chocolate and herbal notes. On the finish, ripe berry and chocolaty oak flavors are generous. Drink through 2019.\n52199\tSpain\t\t89\t10\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVega Montán 2014 Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tVega Montán\tLT_90_Points\tSlightly rubbery black cherry and blackberry aromas are generic but good. This feels round and easygoing, with soft tannins and modest acidity. Black-plum flavors fly solo, while this is nice but hollow on the finish. Drink now.\n84183\tSpain\tTempranillo + Shiraz\t88\t8\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVolteo 2006 Tempranillo + Shiraz Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo Blend\tVolteo\tLT_90_Points\tThe under-$10 high scorer is fast disappearing, so take a good look at this young, jammy Tempranillo-Shiraz blend that hits nicely with ripe boysenberry and black plum. The Shiraz seems to have darkened the wine, and the mouthfeel is ripe and lush.\n35602\tSpain\tSingle Vineyard\t91\t138\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tContino 2004 Single Vineyard  (Rioja)\tGraciano\tContino\tGT_90_Points\tVarietal Graciano will never fit into the mold of “tried and true,” but this 2004 from top-level producer Contino shows the grape in its most positive light. The nose is natural, with hints of cola and ripe berries. The feel is brawny and intense, with semi-searing acids offset by ripe tannins. Finishes well, with a cleansing wave of red fruit and citrusy flavors. More of a novelty than anything, but a fine wine in and of itself.\n25102\tSpain\t\t87\t23\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\t6cepas6 2012  Rioja\tTempranillo\t6cepas6\tLT_90_Points\tFully oaked, candied aromas of maple, vanilla, wood grain and black fruits dominate the nose. The mouthfeel is ruled by sharp acidity and firm tannins, while flavors of chocolaty oak, herbal red fruits and spice exhibit sour tendencies. A layered but tannic finish suggests campfire. Overall, this is muscled up but low on elegance.\n121750\tSpain\tJosep Foraster Macabeu\t83\t21\tCatalonia\tConca de Barberà\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMas Foraster 2013 Josep Foraster Macabeu Macabeo (Conca de Barberà)\tMacabeo\tMas Foraster\tLT_90_Points\tAlmondy in color, with bready, drawn aromas of mustard and pithy citrus, this feels flat and chunky.

On the palate, it's choppy and aggressive with tannic bite. Dark fruit flavors are bolstered by oaky spice, tobacco and chocolate hints that persist long on the finish. A texbook Toro wine.\n52469\tSpain\tGran\t91\t90\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tElias Mora 2009 Gran  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tElias Mora\tGT_90_Points\tGran is a step up from Mora's crianza. The nose deals marzipan, blackberry, raisin and chocolate aromas in front of a smooth, layered palate with toasted berry, vanilla and chocolate flavors. There's a ton of oak on this wine, creating a vanilla and caramel character on the finish. Drink now through 2017.\n98519\tSpain\tVergel\t86\t10\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Bodega de Pinoso 2016 Vergel Rosado (Alicante)\tRosado\tLa Bodega de Pinoso\tLT_90_Points\tFresh, composed aromas suggest a stick of fruit-flavored chewing gum. This wine has a pulpy palate and a hint of spritz that makes it tastes soda-like, with red-apple flavors and a touch of peppery bitterness.\n64506\tSpain\t\t85\t15\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPagos del Moncayo 2011 Garnacha-Syrah (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha-Syrah\tPagos del Moncayo\tLT_90_Points\tThis is punchy and angular up front, with herbal red-fruit aromas. The palate feels fresh, a bit acidic, with peppery, mildly oaky flavors of plum and berry. This is a standard wine with ample body and some oak.\n94523\tSpain\tÀn/2\t91\t25\tSpanish Islands\tVi de la Terra Mallorca\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tÀnima Negra 2011 Àn/2 Red (Vi de la Terra Mallorca)\tRed Blend\tÀnima Negra\tGT_90_Points\tLightly roasted and stalky on the nose, this shows dry aromas of cherry and raspberry along with earthy spice notes. The palate offers proper balance and nothing complicated. Flavors of oak-driven spice, cinnamon and pepper accent earthy plum and berry, while the finish is smooth but a touch hot. Drink through 2017.\n83843\tSpain\t\t81\t18\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSolar de Urbezo 2010 Garnacha (Cariñena)\tGarnacha\tSolar de Urbezo\tLT_90_Points\tBurnt and gritty smelling, with rubbery, meaty berry aromas that turn candied and herbal with airing. This feels hollow, with roasted, stalky flavors and buttery young oak. It's grabby on the finish.\n87973\tSpain\tMenguante\t85\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViñedos y Bodegas Pablo 2015 Menguante Tempranillo (Cariñena)\tTempranillo\tViñedos y Bodegas Pablo\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of candied cherry, leather and tire rubber require some patience and swirling. This Tempranillo feels grabby and pinched, with roasted, almost burnt black-fruit flavors. Salty toasty notes carry a hard but sturdy finish.\n118406\tSpain\tLes Terrasses\t90\t40\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlvaro Palacios 2012 Les Terrasses Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tAlvaro Palacios\tGT_90_Points\tBold cherry, cassis and plum aromas are forward, lively and a touch aggressive. In the mouth, this shows lots of life and generous fruit supported by clamp-down tannins. Earthy, loamy flavors of plum and berry finish warm, earthy and long. Overall, this is more steady, balanced and solid than flashy. Drink through 2017.\n2752\tSpain\t\t84\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRio Madre 2014  Rioja\tTempranillo\tRio Madre\tLT_90_Points\tReedy red-fruit aromas lack the clarity that the best wines of this style show. Grabby on the palate, this tastes of basic plum and raspberry. A raw, tannic, rubbery finish is the final act.\n20132\tSpain\tBrut Reserva\t84\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVilarnau NV Brut Reserva Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tVilarnau\tLT_90_Points\tApple and spice aromas come in front of a soft palate.

The palate is smooth and loamy, with mild tomatoey acidity keeping things fresh. Wiry cherry, plum and baked flavors finish with mocha and stewed notes. Drink now.\n80269\tSpain\tTxakolina\t83\t19\tNorthern Spain\tGetariako Txakolina\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Jakue 2016 Txakolina Hondarrabi Zuri (Getariako Txakolina)\tHondarrabi Zuri\tFinca Jakue\tLT_90_Points\tMild, melony aromas are friendly, but in the mouth, this wine is sharp and hard-edged, with sizzling acidity. Flavors of tart, underripe peach finish with over-the-top citric acidity.\n77534\tSpain\tSelección Familiar Crianza\t88\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLauna 2014 Selección Familiar Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tLauna\tLT_90_Points\tHard and charred on the nose at first, this sheds its tire-like aromas for cleaner berry-fruit notes with airing. A full grabby palate is a bit rough and awkward, while roasted berry, plum and oak flavors finish minty and resiny.\n101504\tSpain\t\t88\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuga 2016 White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tMuga\tLT_90_Points\tSpiced apple and light oak aromas are clean and attractive. This wine feels racy and pure, with good acidic kick. Flavors of nectarine and wood are compatible, while this barrel-fermented Viura (with 10% Malvasia) is solid on the finish.\n91047\tSpain\tReserva Heredad\t88\t25\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSegura Viudas NV Reserva Heredad Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tSegura Viudas\tLT_90_Points\tFresh, clean apple and white-peach aromas are good but not overly expressive or complex. This feels fresh and lifted, with minerally, stony flavors of apple and lime. A clean, pointed finish feels nice and tastes like lettuce and bitter greens.\n19460\tSpain\tSpring in a Bottle\t87\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVerderol 2009 Spring in a Bottle Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tVerderol\tLT_90_Points\tThe opening of green apple and honeydew melon says Rueda all the way. The feel is cleansing and fresh, with piercing but proper acidity pushing flavors of green citrus, melon and green apple. Stony on the finish, with zest. Solid for near-term drinking; don't let it sit around for long.\n85635\tSpain\tSalmos\t92\t35\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTorres 2013 Salmos Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tTorres\tGT_90_Points\tA full package of aromas includes notes of cedar, vanilla, earthy spice and ripe black fruits. Ripeness is no issue on the palate, which feels intense but controlled. Flavors of berry fruits and black currant are chocolaty, with herbal spice notes. Finally, a long powerful finish tastes of spice-infused chocolate. Drink through 2023.\n77975\tSpain\tRare Amontillado Escuadrilla Dry\t90\t25\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLustau NV Rare Amontillado Escuadrilla Dry Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tLustau\tGT_90_Points\tA pure refined bouquet of butterscotch, caramel, spice and dried apricot aromas is appealing.

Savory spice notes come up on a tannic, drying, unyielding finish.\n2151\tSpain\tMade With Organic Grapes\t84\t11\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVenta Morales 2015 Made With Organic Grapes Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo\tVenta Morales\tLT_90_Points\tHeavy oak aromas sit atop wiry plum and spice scents. This feels tannic and tough, with up-front oak and herbal berry flavors. A dry tannic, spicy finish features palpable oak that tastes forced and like plastic.\n27585\tSpain\t\t81\t12\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViñedos y Bodegas Pablo 2015 Garnacha Blanca (Cariñena)\tGarnacha Blanca\tViñedos y Bodegas Pablo\tLT_90_Points\tThis fruitless Garnacha Blanca smells a bit too much like rotting compost. A plump palate holds bitter flavors in front of a pithy finish. Overall, there's very little that's good about this.\n56188\tSpain\tViura Chardonnay\t80\t14\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOchoa 2011 Viura Chardonnay White (Navarra)\tWhite Blend\tOchoa\tLT_90_Points\tAnimal cracker aromas are sweet and the fruit on the nose is mealy on this Viura-Chardonnay blend. The palate is also deficient in that it's watery in feel, but there's some tangy lemon to the flavor profile.\n106614\tSpain\tEsencia Valdemar\t82\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Valdemar 2006 Esencia Valdemar  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Valdemar\tLT_90_Points\tGumball aromas yield to scents of spice and wet animal fur, while the flavor profile settles on tart and thin, with a watery mouthfeel. This is a lean, funky wine that doesn't have a whole lot of Rioja character.\n121697\tSpain\tBembibre\t93\t45\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio de Tares 2012 Bembibre Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tDominio de Tares\tGT_90_Points\tGrapy blackberry and cassis aromas come with charred oak and pastry-like richness. In the mouth, this notoriously ripe Mencía is loaded with tannins. Spicy blackberry flavors can handle the classy oak this wine has seen, while flavors of tobacco, lemon and spice drape over a full-fruited finish. Drink through the 2020s.\n2138\tSpain\tCanchales Vino Joven\t84\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Riojanas 2015 Canchales Vino Joven  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Riojanas\tLT_90_Points\tRubbery raspberry and plum aromas are decent. This feels crisp and abrasive on the surface, but sort of empty in the middle. Lean snappy plum and raspberry flavors end with scratchy tannins and a medicinal aftertaste.\n107205\tSpain\tReserva\t89\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConde de Siruela 2012 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tConde de Siruela\tLT_90_Points\tUnusual but not unpleasant aromas of cinnamon and coffee cake lead to a saturated palate with rugged tannins. Flavors of fig paste, chocolate and baking spices confirm the wine's ripeness, while blackened flavors and rock-hard tannins drive the finish.\n104103\tSpain\tLimited Release\t87\t15\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVionta 2015 Limited Release Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tVionta\tLT_90_Points\tAs this enters its second year in bottle, the nose is still clean and punchy, much like fruit salad. A plump solid mouthfeel holds flavors of salty peach. Beyond that, there's not a lot to say about this standard Albariño. Drink immediately.\n54098\tSpain\tCrianza\t83\t15\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGladium 2005 Crianza Tempranillo (La Mancha)\tTempranillo\tGladium\tLT_90_Points\tMeaty and very oaky, with resin, mocha and milky aromas that amount to a wood cutter's dream. Not surprisingly, the mouthfeel is more shocking and acidic than the oaky bouquet suggests; flavors are racy and tart, and then a bitter lactic quality comes on strong. Too much going on, with nothing pulling in the same direction.\n80700\tSpain\tEcològic\t92\t45\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGenium Celler 2010 Ecològic Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tGenium Celler\tGT_90_Points\tAmong Genium's fine lineup of 2010 Priorat reds, this one stands out for it's schisty nose of cherry, currant and raspberry. A ripe, layered, chiseled palate is tough but rewarding. Cherry, cassis and plum flavors finish fiery and minerally, even by Priorat standards. Drink through 2025.\n38161\tSpain\tVia Cenit\t91\t35\tNorthern Spain\tTierra del Viños de Zamora\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViñas del Cenit 2013 Via Cenit Tempranillo (Tierra del Viños de Zamora)\tTempranillo\tViñas del Cenit\tGT_90_Points\tHeavy oak gives this Tempranillo from Zamora an inky, resiny, charred set of aromas. Its muscular palate is softened somewhat by creamy oak. Woody mocha, blackberry, vanilla and spice flavors linger into the finish, feeling rich but also punchy and tannic. Drink through 2024.\n43470\tSpain\tEmbruix\t90\t27\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVall Llach 2014 Embruix Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tVall Llach\tGT_90_Points\tSchist, cola, cassis, berry and tobacco aroma cover all the bases in this wine. It's grippy and chewy but complete. Dark, earthy mulled berry flavors precede a tannic, pulpy finish with lasting plum and cassis notes. Drink through 2021.\n5620\tSpain\tMorenita Cream\t90\t13\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tHidalgo NV Morenita Cream Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tHidalgo\tGT_90_Points\tSmooth and sweet, like a cream Sherry is supposed to be. On the nose, this one easily shifts from ripe apricot and peach fruit to nuts and saline. The palate starts with a blast of coffee and mocha and then folds in brown sugar and spice. Sweet, long and generous, with accents of cinnamon, clove and mild chocolate. Uncomplicated, which for $13 is a virtue.\n74764\tSpain\t\t90\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTierra Aranda 2012  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo\tTierra Aranda\tGT_90_Points\tSavory notes of olive and rubber share space on the nose with dark berry aromas. This wine feels thick and fleshy, and ultimately a touch heavy and collapsed. Dark, spicy, slightly bitter blackberry flavors finish with a reprise of savory accents. Drink through 2022.\n119263\tSpain\tGarnacha de Fuego Old Vines\t87\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Ateca 2007 Garnacha de Fuego Old Vines Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tBodegas Ateca\tLT_90_Points\tIf the choice is between sleek packaging and good product, take the product every time. And with Garnacha de Fuego, the product is sound to the point of surprising. A bouquet of huge berry aromas is the opening act, followed by flavors of red apple, kirsch and plum. Offers lots of fruit in front of a short, simple finish. And then it's time to open another bottle.\n68678\tSpain\tFinca El Bosque\t93\t152\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSierra Cantabria 2013 Finca El Bosque  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tSierra Cantabria\tGT_90_Points\tAromas of cola nut, bacon, blackberry, licorice and wood smoke announce a raw rugged palate that's not nearly as plump and lush as it normally is: a clear reflection of the cool 2013 vintage in Rioja. Dry peppery black-fruit flavors finish with toasty oak and licorice notes. Although rough and rugged now, this should improve little by little through about 2030.\n114444\tSpain\tLas Umbrías Rozas de Puerto Real\t91\t105\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y León\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tComando-G 2014 Las Umbrías Rozas de Puerto Real Garnacha (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)\tGarnacha\tComando-G\tGT_90_Points\tDry earthy aromas suggest rubber and sea shells along with mild red-fruit scents. This Garnacha from vineyards planted at 3,300 feet feels tight and rubbery. Savory, meaty plum and berry flavors are complex, finishing long and dry on a strong accent of woodspice. Drink now.\n57523\tSpain\tVetiver Tempranillo\t88\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Ontañón 2013 Vetiver Tempranillo Rosado (Rioja)\tRosado\tBodegas Ontañón\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of stone fruits and citrus are dusty and nice; so is the mouthfeel, which is fresh but shows texture and body. Watermelon, nectarine and citrus flavors finish slightly bitter but within reason.\n114607\tSpain\tFaustino VII\t87\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Faustino 2009 Faustino VII  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Faustino\tLT_90_Points\tDusty up front, with leather, red plum and berry aromas. Focused and snappy in the mouth, with forward cherry and plum flavors. Finishes toasty and peppery, and overall this is a juicy wine with crispness, good fruit and spice.\n54873\tSpain\tViña Real Gran Reserva\t93\t59\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCVNE 2006 Viña Real Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tCVNE\tGT_90_Points\tBrandied berry, coconut and marzipan aromas are ripe and heady for CVNE, but super inviting. In the mouth, this is structured and firm, with plenty of acidic cut and snap. Coconut and balsamic berry are the lead flavors, while the finish is herbal and shows a pinch of saltiness along with a dry feel. Drink through 2025.\n57429\tSpain\tHombros\t88\t37\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasar de Burbia 2007 Hombros Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tCasar de Burbia\tLT_90_Points\tBlackberry, tobacco and balsamic aromas lean slightly towards vinegar, and there's a distinct tangy quality to the palate. Otherwise, the wine is very nice, with plum and blackberry flavors. Tobacco notes reappear on the finish along with toasty oak. Will do best with food.\n101651\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t90\t60\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlidis 2011 Gran Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tAlidis\tGT_90_Points\tAlidis is not the most consistent winery in Ribera del Duero, but this gran reserva gets it mostly right. Earthy, slightly mulchy and rubbery berry aromas lead to a saturated bulky palate. Saucy earthy flavors of black fruits finish gritty and a bit leathery, with a jammy weight and a lasting note of black coffee.\n122707\tSpain\tVendimia Seleccionada Reserva\t88\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Muriel 2005 Vendimia Seleccionada Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Muriel\tLT_90_Points\tSolid up front, with sweet and spicy aromas of plum, vanilla and candied berry.

The palate is tight, tannic and rubbery, with roasted, savory flavors of spiced berry and plum. Oak, prune and fig notes work the firm finish.\n122815\tSpain\tMas de Can Blau\t92\t45\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCan Blau 2010 Mas de Can Blau Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tCan Blau\tGT_90_Points\tOaky, inky, modern and full of power, this Montsant blend of Carignan, Syrah and Garnacha is toasty and dark as night on the bouquet. The palate feels ripe and intense, with creamy oak and controlled tannins. Flavors of baked black fruits, cocoa and vanilla finish soft and supple, with just enough tannic grip and acidity to maintain focus. Drink from 2014–2020.\n71783\tSpain\tViña Real\t90\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCVNE 2016 Viña Real Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tCVNE\tGT_90_Points\tNectarine and white-flower aromas are young and pulsing. This Viura feels fresh and elegant, with grip and weight. Oak-driven flavors are controlled and sit atop a white-fruit base, while this finishes clean and easy, with finesse.\n62362\tSpain\tLa Finca Selección Monastrell\t90\t35\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBaica 2015 La Finca Selección Monastrell Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tBaica\tGT_90_Points\tOaky, concentrated black-fruit aromas feature notes of graphite and savory earth. This Monastrell is deep, jammy and textured on a full-bodied palate. Spicy oak and black-plum flavors finish toasty, with hints of baking spices and dried herbs. Drink through 2019.\n30580\tSpain\tConde de Haro Brut\t88\t26\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuga 2010 Conde de Haro Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMuga\tLT_90_Points\tCava from Rioja may not compute but it's definitely an approved category of sparkling wine. This is minerally and smells a lot like vitamins. The palate is round, moderately foamy and wide. Flavors of passion fruit, papaya and nectarine finish smooth, with an easy bubble bead.\n39401\tSpain\tPago Negralada\t92\t100\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y León\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbadia Retuerta 2013 Pago Negralada Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)\tTempranillo\tAbadia Retuerta\tGT_90_Points\tDespite cool conditions in 2013, this is a ripe, healthy Tempranillo. On the nose, wood grain, sawdust, clove and citrus notes are as prominent as berry aromas. The palate feels tight and racy, with pronounced acidity and strong tannins. Flavors of clove, peppery spice and raw oak sit on top of a bed of berry fruit, while a reprise of oak character drives the finish. Drink through 2025.\n60572\tSpain\tReserva\t88\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRamón Bilbao 2004 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tRamón Bilbao\tLT_90_Points\tDark and sultry on the nose, with aromas of burnt toast and raisin that hint at ripeness and some serious oak aging. The wine is juicy yet also a little creamy, with raspberry and plum flavors that are broad and flow nicely across the palate and onto the wide, chewy finish.\n38185\tSpain\tSelección Especial\t87\t15\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Montañana 2010 Selección Especial Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tMarqués de Montañana\tLT_90_Points\tDense and dark, this has earthy, crusty berry aromas and a sprinkle of herb on the nose. It hits with aggression but settles down nicely to offer raspberry, plum and savory herb flavors. Lively acidity allows for a long finish.\n8976\tSpain\tLa Nieta\t93\t149\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViñedos de Paganos 2012 La Nieta  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tViñedos de Paganos\tGT_90_Points\tRipe aromas of prune, cassis and blackberry come with notes of spice cake, minerals and lemon peel. This feels grabby and strong, with pronounced acidity and tannins. Baked blackberry, black currant and toasty flavors are supported by a beam of firm acidity that carries onto the finish. Drink this powerful Rioja now through 2022.\n117314\tSpain\tMerlot\t80\t15\tCentral Spain\tExtremadura\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Santa Marina 2012 Merlot Rosado (Extremadura)\tRosado\tViña Santa Marina\tLT_90_Points\tFrom Spain's broiling Extremadura region, this Merlot-based rosé has a funky nose and mushy, leafy flavors. The finish lacks zest.\n108919\tSpain\tAltos Lanzaga Gran Viñedo\t84\t130\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodríguez 2008 Altos Lanzaga Gran Viñedo  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tTelmo Rodríguez\tLT_90_Points\tFrom a mediocre vintage, it seems as though the winery poured on the fully toasted oak to cover up marginal fruit. This smells like burnt meat and rubber, tastes charred and baked, and finishes blackened and overly toasty, with a choppy feel and hard tannins.\n40886\tSpain\t\t83\t7\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDespierta 2014 Verdejo (La Mancha)\tVerdejo\tDespierta\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of dish soap and kitchen cleanser don't stink but they aren't impressive, either. Round on the palate, with low acidity, this tastes of chunky, mealy apple and finishes tired and briny.\n38252\tSpain\tConde Valdemar Crianza\t89\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Valdemar 2011 Conde Valdemar Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Valdemar\tLT_90_Points\tGranular, earthy aromas of baked berry fruits come with a hint of raisin. Tight tannins are the framework for this Crianza, which tastes of toasty blueberry and cassis. Touches of mint and herbs can be found on a juicy but slightly hollow finish.\n32934\tSpain\t\t88\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArrocal 2006  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo Blend\tArrocal\tLT_90_Points\tAfter an initial blast of raw oak this Ribera settles nicely to show appealing leather and berry aromas along with savory blackberry and molasses flavors. There's also ample spice, chocolate and toast to give it a dark personality. Nice for a young wine; it's flush, lush and quite dense.\n80251\tSpain\t\t83\t7\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCampos Reales 2016 Rosé (La Mancha)\tRosé\tCampos Reales\tLT_90_Points\tChewing-gum aromas struggle to stay clean and fresh. This rosé feels rubbery and raw. Herbal flavors include juniper berry and finish with almost no fruit.\n101406\tSpain\tNaiades\t88\t29\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNaia 2006 Naiades Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tNaia\tLT_90_Points\tDefinitely a particular wine, meaning it's fully oaked and probably not for everyone. But if you don't mind full-out barrel notes on your citrusy Verdejo, then you should like it. There's honey, toast, popcorn, pepper and vanilla aromas and flavors, all courtesy of barrel fermentation. It's also smooth and clean, with good core acidity and balance. Nice wine; not Burgundy; not for all palates.\n80884\tSpain\tVallobera Crianza\t87\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSan Pedro 1999 Vallobera Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tSan Pedro\tLT_90_Points\tDeep but reticent on the nose, with somewhat muted cherry and blackberry aromas. Plum and black-fruit flavors come prior to a dark, mouth-filling finish that's properly tannic and entirely substantive. For a mid-price Rioja there's depth, and beyond that the flavors and feel are clean and attractive.\n24903\tSpain\t\t87\t13\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNora 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tNora\tLT_90_Points\tThis is as basic as Albariño gets, with aromas of sweet apple and pear. It feels round and a bit soft, with fleshy peach and dry melon flavors. The finish is pithy, with a white pepper note and an indication that the wine is starting to fade. Drink immediately.\n86329\tSpain\tCuveé de O\t88\t18\tNorthern Spain\tValdeorras\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAvanthia 2012 Cuveé de O Godello (Valdeorras)\tGodello\tAvanthia\tLT_90_Points\tTropical fruit aromas, lime and minerality create an appealing bouquet. This feels tangy but a touch hollow, with modest body weight and flavors of green apple, orange and lemon-lime. A chiseled, racy finish makes this the perfect pairing for Asian foods and sushi.\n49398\tSpain\tCrianza\t82\t12\tCentral Spain\tValdepeñas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Moral 2007 Crianza Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)\tTempranillo\tMarques de Moral\tLT_90_Points\tStemmy, earthy aromas of cherry and hard spice lead to a rough palate with hard cherry and berry flavors. It blackens up on a pounding finish; this is edgy and rough stuff.\n119817\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViñestral 2014 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tViñestral\tLT_90_Points\tCherry, plum and balsam-wood aromas make for a good opening. This wine feels full, with cheek-grabbing tannins. Flavors of woodspice, cherry and plum hold appeal, but this feels a bit hot on the finish, with residual oak.\n109309\tSpain\tTérmino de Arriba\t86\t20\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tHilanda 2009 Término de Arriba Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tHilanda\tLT_90_Points\tBlack fruit, clove, char and mocha are the primary aromas on this heavily oaked, saturated Monastrell. The palate shows bullish tannins, bold acids and weight, while dark-leaning flavors of blackberry, stewed plum and mint come with enough acidity to cut through the wine's fat and oak.\n4210\tSpain\tSelección Especial\t87\t20\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y León\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPradorey 2015 Selección Especial Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)\tVerdejo\tPradorey\tLT_90_Points\tRight away this smells big and waxy, with lightly oxidized, pulpy melon aromas and a hint of seawater. A high-acid medium-bodied palate deals salty flavors of corn and melon, while the finish is fresh, full and a touch pithy in flavor.\n123758\tSpain\tVendimia Seleccionada\t86\t\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Gormaz 2011 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tViña Gormaz\tLT_90_Points\tThere's plenty of berry fruit on the nose of this Ribera red. The palate feels fresh and acidic, with a mild streak of softer, buttery oak. Flavors of crisp plum and cassis are sharpened by said acidity yet smoothed out by oaky vanilla on the finish.\n32535\tSpain\tBarrel Fermented White\t84\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Cáceres 2007 Barrel Fermented White White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tMarqués de Cáceres\tLT_90_Points\tPithy, heavy and chunky, with waxy fruit mixed with oak. The wine has a pretty good mouthfeel and balance, but it just doesn't do much in terms of aromatics or in the flavor category. Decent for a barrel fermented Viura but nothing to write home about.\n67486\tSpain\tSelecció\t88\t30\tCatalonia\tTerra Alta\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEdetària 2013 Selecció Grenache Blanc (Terra Alta)\tGrenache Blanc\tEdetària\tLT_90_Points\tWaxy aromas of lanolin, dried apple and cheese set up a plump well-balanced palate, with plenty of body weight and adequate acidity. Peach, apple and melon flavors are moderately stony and minerally, while this varietal Garnacha Blanca finishes with good length.\n42169\tSpain\tConde Valdemar\t83\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Valdemar 2016 Conde Valdemar Rosé (Rioja)\tRosé\tBodegas Valdemar\tLT_90_Points\tFruit-salad aromas include a note of chewing gum. This feels basic, with tart vapid tomato flavors. A saucy-tasting finish is bland as a board.\n58270\tSpain\tFlores de Callejo\t86\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFelix Callejo 2010 Flores de Callejo  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tFelix Callejo\tLT_90_Points\tThis basic but good wine opens with powerful, dark and brawny berry and rubber-like aromas. The palate feels beefy and broad, with thick, pummeling tannins. Baked black-fruit flavors end short with coffee and bitter chocolate notes.\n87846\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSeñorio de Uñuela 2008 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tSeñorio de Uñuela\tLT_90_Points\tChunky aromas of sweet berry and beets announce a ripe style of Rioja. The mouthfeel is medium to full and healthy, with focused flavors of berry, oak and peppery spice. Long and a little fiery on the finish.\n110045\tSpain\tOloroso Single Vintage Single Vineyard\t92\t155\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Hidalgo 1986 Oloroso Single Vintage Single Vineyard Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tBodegas Hidalgo\tGT_90_Points\tOnly 100 cases of this vintage-designated oloroso were made, and now it smells mature, nutty and oily. A full, elegant palate shows the right weight and acidic cut, while salty flavors of peanut and caramel finish long, nutty and a touch hot due to 22% abv.\n38604\tSpain\tBrut Reserva\t88\t13\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJuvé y Camps 2006 Brut Reserva Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tJuvé y Camps\tLT_90_Points\tSnappy and a little green on the nose, with hints of juniper and green apple. The palate is perfectly good but nothing special, while the flavors of apple and citrus are punchy and pure. Frothy but controlled, with lots of flavor and forward kick. Apéritif city!\n43728\tSpain\tTorre de Golbán Crianza\t88\t19\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAtalayas de Golbán 2009 Torre de Golbán Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tAtalayas de Golbán\tLT_90_Points\tLeathery aromas of earth and berry fruits are solid and round. This feels thick and jammy, with a resiny feel. Flavors of baked black fruits are ripe, chunky and chewy, while the finish is rich and a bit hot. Everyhting about this full-bodied RDD says warm year and drink now.\n45562\tSpain\t\t82\t12\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEquilibrio 2014 Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla)\tMonastrell-Syrah\tEquilibrio\tLT_90_Points\tThis Monastrell-Syrah blend feels grabby and tight, while the flavor profile goes in the direction of weedy and resiny. A stalky tasting, almost green finish has a rubbery feel to it.\n43044\tSpain\tArnegui\t87\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPagos del Rey 2014 Arnegui  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tPagos del Rey\tLT_90_Points\tFresh, dry red-fruit aromas lead the charge on this tasty but simple Rioja that feels crisp, healthy and balanced. Flavors of plum, raspberry and herbs finish mild.\n38884\tSpain\tLos Dos Old Vines\t86\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlmira 2008 Los Dos Old Vines Grenache-Syrah (Campo de Borja)\tGrenache-Syrah\tAlmira\tLT_90_Points\tNice value red wine with solid black fruit aromas, licorice and crushed mineral notes. It's flush and showing good volume, and the plum/berry core flavors have a vanilla accent. Mildly medicinal on the finish but overall it offers good power, structure and concentration.\n22183\tSpain\tOloroso Dulce Cream\t87\t11\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOsborne NV Oloroso Dulce Cream Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tOsborne\tLT_90_Points\tNice and familiar, and very much in the sweet, creamy style. There's almond candy and caramel on the palate and then maple syrup on the finish. Soft and sweet throughout, with just enough acidity and complexity to save it from being boring.\n76488\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCruz de Alba 2007 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tCruz de Alba\tLT_90_Points\tQuite ripe and dark, with blackberry, raisin and aromas of woody spice manifested as cinnamon. The palate shows a controlled sharpness and then flavors of saturated berry fruit accented by oak-based notes of vanilla and dill weed. A powerful, deep style of crianza with a lot of oak.\n113208\tSpain\t\t89\t18\tGalicia\tRibeiro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVilerma 2015 White (Ribeiro)\tWhite Blend\tVilerma\tLT_90_Points\tGold in color, with pineapple, lanolin and air-freshener aromas, this Treixadura-led blend feels round and creamy, with a shot of bracing acidity. Salty tropical fruit and flowery flavors finish plump in feel and briny in flavor.\n56040\tSpain\t234\t80\t17\tNorthern Spain\tSomontano\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEnate 2013 234 Chardonnay (Somontano)\tChardonnay\tEnate\tLT_90_Points\tSweet melon and peach aromas are candied. In the mouth, this is awkward, fizzy and cloying. The flavor profile has little positive to offer, while the finish turns bitter and grassy tasting.\n9077\tSpain\tFlor de Vetus Old Vines From Segovia\t89\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVetus 2016 Flor de Vetus Old Vines From Segovia Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tVetus\tLT_90_Points\tWhite-fruit aromas and a prickly scent of cactus or nettle opens this tight, citrusy old-vines Verdejo. Matching the aromas, this tastes of pithy citrus, grapefruit and green herbs. A racy finish fades out nicely.\n45882\tSpain\tEstate Grown and Bottled\t86\t9\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEsperanza 2016 Estate Grown and Bottled White (Rueda)\tWhite Blend\tEsperanza\tLT_90_Points\tLemon and tangerine aromas are slightly dusty. In the mouth, this Viura-Verdejo combo is lively and bouncy. Pithy citrus, almond-skin and apple flavors finish juicy.\n29109\tSpain\t\t89\t18\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Caña 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tLa Caña\tLT_90_Points\tFriendly familiar aromas of lees, seashell, lemon, melon and apple set up a shearing pointed palate. Flavors of lemon-lime, green apple and gooseberry are propelled by minerally acidity, while the finish is fresh and well cut.\n69889\tSpain\t\t87\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEsperanza 2008 Verdejo-Viura (Rueda)\tVerdejo-Viura\tEsperanza\tLT_90_Points\tA clean, almost oceanic opening is fresh and citrusy as it should be, while the palate shows pulse, balance and a little scour to go with orange, grapefruit and other citrusy flavors. Pithy and biting late, with ample fruit throughout.\n20581\tSpain\tParticular\t86\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas San Valero 2013 Particular White (Cariñena)\tWhite Blend\tBodegas San Valero\tLT_90_Points\tWhile this is largely neutral-smelling, it's flush in the mouth, with pithy citrus and green apple flavors. Lasting and steady on the finish, this blend of Chardonnay and Muscat is juicy and alert after initial dull aromas. Maritime Wine Trading Collective, Vintage Wines Inc.\n26051\tSpain\t\t84\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBeso de Vino 2015 Syrah-Grenache (Cariñena)\tSyrah-Grenache\tBeso de Vino\tLT_90_Points\tStewy aromas of berry fruits and wet dog are barely acceptable. This wine feels plump and round, with reasonable balance. Flavors of black plum, blackberry and mocha end with notes of coffee and soft tannins.\n33969\tSpain\tLa Conreria\t88\t24\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Conreria d'Scala Dei 2009 La Conreria Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tLa Conreria d'Scala Dei\tLT_90_Points\tGritty and raisiny up front, this has notes of tar and jammy blackberry. It feels resiny and tough, with carob, chocolate, baked berry and roasted plum flavors. The chocolate element persists on the finish, which is big, tannic and lasting.\n89789\tSpain\tCrianza\t89\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAspaldi 2010 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tAspaldi\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy notes of porcini mushroom and black olive blend with balsamic plum and cherry aromas. This is a touch heavy and syrupy in feel, and thus creamy flavors of chocolate, plum and berry are not surprising. On the finish, this remains creamy and ripe.\n101006\tSpain\tEl Miracle by Mariscal\t84\t15\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVicente Gandia 2014 El Miracle by Mariscal Garnacha Tintorera (Valencia)\tGarnacha Tintorera\tVicente Gandia\tLT_90_Points\tStalky compost and wilted floral aromas are as present as the underlying basic berry scents. This varietal Alicante Bouschet is tannic and slightly abrasive in feel, while warm, bitter, peppery plum and cherry flavors leave heat and burn on the finish.\n9191\tSpain\tReserva\t86\t19\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo Clavijo 2006 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tCastillo Clavijo\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of pencil lead, rubber and spice accent distant red fruit notes. The palate is none too deep, with dilution and bracing acidity. Tastes perky and lightly leafy, with cherry, raspberry, dry spice and finally buttery oak. Whispy but hollow for an '06 reserva.\n114403\tSpain\t\t88\t40\tCentral Spain\tManchuela\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAltolandon 2005 Red (Manchuela)\tRed Blend\tAltolandon\tLT_90_Points\tA little too fiery and monotone for me. Noticeable alcohol, on the nose and at the end, weighs down the edges, and frankly the dark-style fruit is forced to wear a heavy blanket of sizzle and barrel char. Has its merits, but you better be able to handle the menthol, cola, char and heat to get into the game.\n33577\tSpain\tMicaela Amontillado\t88\t16\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Barón NV Micaela Amontillado Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tBodegas Barón\tLT_90_Points\tLively but standard amontillado aromas of maple, honey and nuts are a touch fiery. Matching the nose, this is choppy and pulling on the palate. Salty, nutty, intensely dry flavors finish with hard-driving acidity that creates never-ending length.\n121593\tSpain\tNavia\t89\t31\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Caña 2013 Navia Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tLa Caña\tLT_90_Points\tA yellowish color announces this oaked Albariño. Aromas of sunflower seeds and stone fruits are more mellow than loud. Creamy and full bodied, this benefits from bold malic acidity. Flavors of summer corn, dried apple and wood resin finish salty. Drink now with fish, crab or lobster.\n95246\tSpain\t\t83\t11\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tToscar 2010 Monastrell (Alicante)\tMonastrell\tToscar\tLT_90_Points\tMedicinal cherry and plum aromas are smothered in milk chocolate scents that turn more animal and leathery with airing. The palate is chunky but dull in feel, with generic red-berry flavors covered with candied oak and herbal notes.\n77897\tSpain\tCrianza\t85\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRamón Bilbao 2013 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tRamón Bilbao\tLT_90_Points\tForceful oak creates aromas of creosote, shoe polish, raw wood grain and leathery berry. This is high in acid, and hence rather sharp. Tart, snappy plum and pie cherry flavors finish fresh and tangy, but angular.\n115794\tSpain\t\t93\t34\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Coronado 2004 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tRed Blend\tFinca Coronado\tGT_90_Points\tFans of Miguel Angel de Gregorio's Finca Allende wines from Rioja will want to snap up this excellent, lush-styled blend of Graciano, Merlot and Petit Verdot from La Mancha. This wine almost proves that talent is as important as terroir, because no other La Mancha wine features this grape blend, these rich and pure medicinal flavors, and a smooth-handed sense of balance that calls for drinking now through 2013.\n3237\tSpain\tTreyu\t88\t16\tNorthern Spain\tEmpordà\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOliver Conti 2011 Treyu White (Empordà)\tWhite Blend\tOliver Conti\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple. The palate is fresh and quick moving, with mild peach, pear, apple and melon flavors that culminate in a solid finish that's not very exciting but doesn't stray.\n61019\tSpain\tOld Vines Reserva\t84\t17\tCentral Spain\tValdepeñas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Navarro López 2006 Old Vines Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Navarro López\tLT_90_Points\tSmells green and leafy, with tomato leaf, oregano and grassy aromas. Feels clampy and biting, with gritty tannins and roasted, slightly bitter flavors of black plum and pepper. Burnt tasting on the finish.\n54829\tSpain\tM2 de Matallana\t85\t39\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodríguez 2004 M2 de Matallana  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tTelmo Rodríguez\tLT_90_Points\tExpect no shortage of power and pounding tannins from this modern-styled, heavily extracted Tempranillo. The nose is dark, sweet and jammy, but all pleasantries cease there; the palate is tannic as nails, with baked plum and other roasted dark-fruit flavors. To this taster, it's a hard, tough wine. Others may find it more appealing.\n35634\tSpain\tPicos Pardos\t88\t32\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Hidalgo 2015 Picos Pardos Grenache (Calatayud)\tGrenache\tBodegas Hidalgo\tLT_90_Points\tAt first, this black-colored Garnacha smells horsey and reduced, but with time it exudes more aromatic harmony and quality. A big tannic palate is rough like sandpaper. Blackberry, pepper and chocolate flavors don't rise to a level of excellence, while a heavy saturated finish closes out this muscular red.\n53536\tSpain\t\t89\t30\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAljibes 2012 Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tSyrah\tAljibes\tLT_90_Points\tInitial aromas of horsey red-berry fruits are jammy as well as grassy. This feels blocky and static on the palate, while plum and berry flavors are more generic than specific. A finish with licorice, pepper and spice flavors is bold, with firm tannic grip.\n48909\tSpain\t\t95\t85\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVall Llach 2005 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tVall Llach\tGT_90_Points\tFor the second vintage in a row, Vall Llach's signature red blend is out on its own. The bouquet is round and deep, with alluring cola, mint and blackberry aromas. The palate is alive but still quite dark, with huge black plum and blackberry flavors. Super long on the finish, with a subtle streak of vanilla and coconut. Delicious but also deft. 450 cases produced.\n123443\tSpain\t\t87\t9\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Cáceres 2011 Rosé (Rioja)\tRosé\tMarqués de Cáceres\tLT_90_Points\tPink in color, this has fresh, clean aromas of stone fruits.

A fine summer sipper.\n64504\tSpain\tNuestra Selección\t85\t36\tCentral Spain\tFinca Élez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tManuel Manzaneque 2005 Nuestra Selección Red (Finca Élez)\tRed Blend\tManuel Manzaneque\tLT_90_Points\tThis single-pago wine is earthy, rooty, herbal and almost grassy smelling. The mouthfeel is clampy, with dried berry, herbal shadings and a chunky, earthy finish. As a whole there's a malty character to this wine, but it has elements of quality and character.\n85727\tSpain\t\t89\t73\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOráculo 2009  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo\tOráculo\tLT_90_Points\tCharcoal aromas shadow standard black fruit scents. This is forward in its approach, with a sturdy mouthfeel. Black plum and blackberry flavors feature a lot of vanilla and cream, while the finish is mild, straightforward and tastes mostly like oak and associated vanilla. Drink now through 2020.\n112790\tSpain\tCrianza\t87\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCondado de Oriza 2003 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tCondado de Oriza\tLT_90_Points\tA maturing wine with aromas of burnt leaves, dill, leather and shaded black fruit. It opens up on the palate, revealing cherry, raspberry and plum flavors along with ancillary vanilla. With medium tannins and moderate acidity, the wine shows no ill effects of the broiling 2003 vintage. Drink now.\n115935\tSpain\tNaiades\t84\t37\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNaia 2012 Naiades Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tNaia\tLT_90_Points\tCombine a warm year with too much time in bottle and this is what you get. This chunky, barrel-fermented Verdejo smells and tastes of early oxidation; it's creamy on the palate and strained in terms of flavors. Wheaty, leesy, faded melon and apple flavors have lost their verve.\n121098\tSpain\t9 Barricas\t87\t70\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRioja Vega 2008 9 Barricas  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tRioja Vega\tLT_90_Points\tPiercing on the nose, with hickory smoke, char and exotic boysenberry aromas. Feels high in acid and low in density, with a tight and biting mouthfeel along with heavily oaked flavors of berry fruit, vanilla, butter and coconut. Very fresh and colorful, but lacking in stuffing and complexity.\n128955\tSpain\tChristina\t91\t90\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAstrales 2012 Christina  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tAstrales\tGT_90_Points\tMore than in the past, this vintage of Christina is showing a ton of oak up front along with vanilla, plastic and hickory aromas. Round, staunch and tannic on the palate, this single-vineyard Tinto Fino tastes toasted, blackened and minty, with blackberry, peppercorn and licorice flavors; hold until 2017.\n118395\tSpain\tFont de la Figuera\t90\t40\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tClos Figueras 2013 Font de la Figuera White (Priorat)\tWhite Blend\tClos Figueras\tGT_90_Points\tWaxy, honeyed aromas of melon and white flowers lead to a plump, leesy, creamy but balanced palate full of bready notes, stone-fruit flavors and vanilla. Another wave of leesy vanilla, melon, tropical fruit and cream takes over the finish. This contains Viognier, Garnacha Blanca and Chenin Blanc, a small portion of which was barrel fermented.\n39454\tSpain\tMas de Can Blau\t93\t45\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCan Blau 2007 Mas de Can Blau Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tCan Blau\tGT_90_Points\tA big, balanced, bombastic Montsant made from one-third each of Mazuelo, Garnacha and Syrah.

Drink now through 2015.\n26396\tSpain\tClos Figueres\t92\t90\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tClos Figueras 2006 Clos Figueres Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tClos Figueras\tGT_90_Points\tBaked, earthy, minerally berry fruit aromas suggest lead pencil, roasted plum, cassis and raspberry.

This feels smooth and slightly round despite showing firm acidity. Nectarine and melon flavors end with lasting minerality and a stone-fruit character. As per usual, As Laxas doesn't disappoint.\n65407\tSpain\t\t91\t24\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPittacum 2007 Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tPittacum\tGT_90_Points\tA bit rubbery and earthy at first but with time it develops, yielding syrupy berry aromas, woodsy oak notes and dried cheese. The palate feel is deep, lush and silky smooth, while it tastes of ripe berry, coconut and vanilla. Softer than some, with a lush texture that will allow for near-term drinking.\n19543\tSpain\tAltos de Losada\t90\t39\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLosada 2014 Altos de Losada Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tLosada\tGT_90_Points\tSmooth cool aromas of cedar, lemon peel and cola accent black-fruit scents on this easygoing Mencía.

Flavors of blackberry, cassis and prune end with cookie-like notes of Graham cracker as well as toast. As a whole, this Syrah-Garnacha-Cabernet Sauvignon blend is muscular, tannic and brawny; drink through 2020.\n44761\tSpain\tTebaida\t93\t76\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasar de Burbia 2013 Tebaida Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tCasar de Burbia\tGT_90_Points\tDark, smoky, oaky aromas of tobacco, leather and black fruits lead to a palate that's muscular, tannic and solid as a pile of rocks. Cool, earthy black-fruit flavors include woodspice and dark-chocolate notes. This Mencía from a cold year is flush, rugged and dry on the finish.

The palate feel is total purity and silk, while smooth flavors of black cherry, nutmeg and cocoa blend with pepper, chocolate and mineral notes on what can best be described as a delicious finish. Drink now through 2016.\n111569\tSpain\tTio Pepe Fino En Rama\t90\t26\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGonzález Byass NV Tio Pepe Fino En Rama Palomino (Jerez)\tPalomino\tGonzález Byass\tGT_90_Points\tPine resin, apple and sea brine aromas set up a plump palate with a slick mouthfeel. Dry slightly bitter melon and salty flavors finish long and briny, which is standard for a well-made fino like this.\n91675\tSpain\tOld Vine\t82\t17\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo de Monséran 2008 Old Vine Garnacha (Cariñena)\tGarnacha\tCastillo de Monséran\tLT_90_Points\tThis is dry, herbal and leathery on the nose. On the palate, this feels snappy and crisp, with flavors of peppery red fruits that are leafy, herbal and almost green. Turns hotter and sharper the longer it breathes.\n83848\tSpain\tCircles Syrah & Garnacha\t80\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Virgen del Águila 2010 Circles Syrah & Garnacha Syrah-Grenache (Cariñena)\tSyrah-Grenache\tBodegas Virgen del Águila\tLT_90_Points\tThis starts with aromas of cinnamon, hard candy and weedy red fruits.

Lightly buttery white-fruit flavors are mildly salty on the finish, sort of like saltines.\n119338\tSpain\tCrianza\t87\t26\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCyan 2010 Crianza  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tCyan\tLT_90_Points\tThere are positives and negatives to this tinta de toro. The nose is outright stalky and roasted, with a shortage of purity. The palate is huge and grossly tannic, a monster if you will. Flavors of sweet black fruits are stalky in nature, while prune, blackberry and herbal flavors drive the finish.\n71630\tSpain\t\t83\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBitácora 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tBitácora\tLT_90_Points\tMonotone aromas of apple and citrus are stalky and suggest that this is in decline. Mild citrus flavors are stalky like the nose, while this finishes with pithy, bitter notes of lemon.\n31694\tSpain\tRosa de Arrocal\t81\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArrocal 2012 Rosa de Arrocal Rosé (Ribera del Duero)\tRosé\tArrocal\tLT_90_Points\tSpiced berry and plum aromas are holding in there. This is blatantly acidic and citric, with cranberry and raspberry flavors that finish tart before falling off.\n63299\tSpain\t\t87\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTrillón 2013 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tTrillón\tLT_90_Points\tLeesy aromas of vanilla and white flowers feature notes of peach and melon. This is round on the palate, with pear, honeydew and apple flavors. A rebound of leesy vanilla reappears on a mellow finish. Drink immediately or wait for the 2014.\n41652\tSpain\tArtazuri Garnacha\t87\t11\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArtadi 2013 Artazuri Garnacha Rosé (Navarra)\tRosé\tArtadi\tLT_90_Points\tClean, fresh, presentable aromas of red fruits are easy to like. This is balanced and offers just enough body to support cherry, nectarine and citrus flavors. The finish is crisp and lingers nicely.\n106671\tSpain\t\t83\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCruz de Piedra 2013 Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tCruz de Piedra\tLT_90_Points\tFunky aromas of animal fur and lively berry are not that inviting. In the mouth, this has a narrow feel and high acidity. Herbal, tart flavors of plum and red currant are almost sour, while the finish is on the green and herbal side.\n123115\tSpain\tTxakoli Aitzalde\t88\t18\tNorthern Spain\tGetariako Txakolina\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLasalde Elkartea 2015 Txakoli Aitzalde Hondarrabi Zuri (Getariako Txakolina)\tHondarrabi Zuri\tLasalde Elkartea\tLT_90_Points\tGrassy aromas and a whiff of celery lead to a snappy palate with fresh but tart lemon, gooseberry and white-currant flavors.

This feels round and healthy, with modest flavors of resin, salt, apple and nectarine. Saline stays present on the finish, which is fresh but resiny in flavor.\n69821\tSpain\tTinto Fino Roble\t83\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEmina 2016 Tinto Fino Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tEmina\tLT_90_Points\tWild berry aromas are foxy and smell a bit like vinegar. This dark young Tempranillo is severely tannic and hard as rocks. Blackberry and boysenberry flavors finish salty and with rugged leftover tannins.\n118371\tSpain\t\t84\t7\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVenta Morales 2011 Tempranillo (La Mancha)\tTempranillo\tVenta Morales\tLT_90_Points\tFresh raspberry and plum aromas are minty but get the job done. This feels raw but not scouring, with prodding acidity and herbal berry, vanilla and paste flavors. Minty, herbal finishing notes touch up against herbaceous.\n33139\tSpain\tEl Circo Acróbata\t85\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGrandes Vinos y Viñedos 2013 El Circo Acróbata Garnacha (Cariñena)\tGarnacha\tGrandes Vinos y Viñedos\tLT_90_Points\tFloral red-plum aromas come with a welcome note of wild herbs. A punchy, stout palate is juicy and possesses short, bold plum and boysenberry flavors. This bright Garnacha doesn't fall off on the finish; it's a good choice for burgers or tacos.\n118370\tSpain\t\t84\t10\tSpain Other\tSpain\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTarantas NV Sparkling (Spain)\tSparkling Blend\tTarantas\tLT_90_Points\tA mellow, neutral nose doesn't push the envelope. In the mouth, this is round but punchy, with some excess weight. Flavors of apple juice, pear and melon finish with flavors of lime, apple cider and powdered sugar.\n36709\tSpain\tBarrica\t84\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMartín Berdugo 2005 Barrica  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tMartín Berdugo\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with candied berry and salinic aromas. It's tough in its youth and also a little too funky to inspire much confidence for the future. Toughness in tannins; toughness in fruit; quite peppery on the finish. It just isn't that inviting.\n27117\tSpain\t\t82\t11\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Antigua 2013 Viura (La Mancha)\tViura\tFinca Antigua\tLT_90_Points\tDusty, slightly skunky aromas of citrus fruits are basic at best.

It finishes acidic and herbaceous.\n44177\tSpain\tBrut Rosé\t85\t18\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVilarnau NV Brut Rosé Red (Cava)\tRed Blend\tVilarnau\tLT_90_Points\tOrange and nectarine aromas carry the nose to a wide, fairly acidic palate that still manages to fall a little flat in terms of character. Mid-tier notes of orange and stone fruit set up a finish with similar flavors.\n109121\tSpain\tCastillo de Fuendejalon Crianza\t86\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Aragonesas 2009 Castillo de Fuendejalon Crianza Red (Campo de Borja)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Aragonesas\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy berry and cola aromas are clean and ripe. This feels fresh on the tongue, with medium-level weight and power. Flavors run toward cassis and berry but fade quickly, with little to the finish. This is Garnacha with 25% Tempranillo.\n26577\tSpain\tParticular\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas San Valero 2015 Particular Chardonnay (Cariñena)\tChardonnay\tBodegas San Valero\tLT_90_Points\tClean, basic apple and pear aromas lead to a high-energy palate with medium weight and freshness.

Fuentes Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tFuentes\tLT_90_Points\tRooty aromas of raisin and stewed plum are a touch hot as this tips the scale at 15.5%. High in acidity and low in body fat, the palate is linear. Short berry and root beer flavors are mature. Hollow on the finish. Drink through 2019.\n124581\tSpain\tFlor del Montgó\t83\t12\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMontgó 2009 Flor del Montgó Verdejo (La Mancha)\tVerdejo\tMontgó\tLT_90_Points\tPineapple aromas lead to a soft, smooth, but lifeless palate of slightly bitter melon and banana flavors. Pithy on the finish and short on pulse. Drink immediately or let it go by altogether.\n82702\tSpain\t\t88\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Nueva 2008 Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tFinca Nueva\tLT_90_Points\tFrom Miguel Angel de Gregorio of Finca Allende, this is a nice, thorough, creamy white with aromas of white fruits, vanilla and straw. The palate has spiced peach, apple and pear flavors, and the finish is exceedingly creamy and deep. Shows elegance and adequate power, but needs to be drunk soon.\n112742\tSpain\tMás de Leda\t88\t20\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y León\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Leda 2007 Más de Leda Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Leda\tLT_90_Points\tBig, extracted and clumsy on first blush, with raisin and prune preceding chocolate on the nose.

This feels about right, with citric acidity maintaining balance. Flavors of candied orange and cantaloupe finish with obvious residual sugar along with modest acidic cut.\n39519\tSpain\tReserva Heredad\t87\t25\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSegura Viudas NV Reserva Heredad Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tSegura Viudas\tLT_90_Points\tGrassy and sweet smelling, with apple and lightly candied aromas.

In the mouth, hard tannins and aggressiveness rule the show. Flavors of baked, meaty, toasty berry fruits finish smoky, chocolaty and savory, with a pinch of green herbs.\n107216\tSpain\tBlanco\t89\t80\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRemelluri 2013 Blanco White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tRemelluri\tLT_90_Points\tA mature nose of cornbread and oxidized fruits suggests a wine older than this. A white blend, it features a multitude of grapes led by Viura. On the palate, acidity is the key ingredient, while a mix of oxidized apple, melon and corn flavors runs long on the finish. Drink through 2022.\n1545\tSpain\tTina 20\t85\t20\tCatalonia\tAlella\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRaventós de Alella 2015 Tina 20 Pansa Blanca (Alella)\tPansa Blanca\tRaventós de Alella\tLT_90_Points\tThis varietal Xarello feels more flat than vivid.

Drink through 2020.\n83891\tSpain\tCrianza\t89\t\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Mayor 2008 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tViña Mayor\tLT_90_Points\tSolid cherry and berry aromas are smooth and appealing, while a spot of pinched leather adds character to the nose.

The palate has a narrow feel with ample acidity and a light body for Ribera del Duero. Flavors run in the direction of stewed plum, while the finish feels rough and tastes a bit raisiny.\n18520\tSpain\t\t90\t15\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Molet 2009 Red (Valencia)\tTempranillo Blend\tEl Molet\tGT_90_Points\tSweet blackberry aromas come with floral edgings, and the whole is impressive.

It's a forward Cava with a yeasty, creamy feel. Its acidity and proper bubbles set up flavors of pastry, powdered sugar and sweet apple.

Still fresh courtesy of core acidity, with green melon, passion fruit, grapefruit and citrus flavors.

The palate is crisp but not assaulting like a splash of battery acid, and the flavors of apple, saline and minerality are true to Txakoli. Finishes like zesty apple cider; drink immediately.\n62621\tSpain\tEmbruix\t88\t27\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVall Llach 2012 Embruix Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tVall Llach\tLT_90_Points\tFloral blueberry and boysenberry aromas are forward and slightly exotic, with notes of leather and dried cheese. This is chunky, heavy and a touch flat, with grabbing, cheek-scrubbing tannins. Ripe berry flavors are earthy and show a touch of chocolate, while the finish is baked, ripe, jammy and tannic. Drink through 2018.\n97168\tSpain\tAntaño\t82\t8\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJ. Garcia Carrion 2007 Antaño  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tJ.

Sweet but balanced dark fruit and cola aromas are nice, while the palate is forward and tastes of blackberry and cola. Complex and slightly gritty and tannic on the finish, which indicates that it has the structure to age. Drink now through 2013.\n3754\tSpain\t\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Coto 2015 Rosado (Rioja)\tRosado\tEl Coto\tLT_90_Points\tLightly pickled citrus aromas include a note of pyrazines.

Savory plum and black cherry flavors finish with integrated spice notes.

This feels wide grabby and tannic, while jammy flavors of raspberry and plum finish chunky and expansive, but also tannic and wan. Drink now.\n84531\tSpain\tReserva\t88\t21\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMileto 2009 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMileto\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of spicy oak and dried berry fruits lead to a clampy, rubbery palate. Plum and berry flavors are slightly saucy, while the finish, which is still fresh for a 2009, is tannic and pulling.\n39511\tSpain\tFinca Ygay Reserva\t88\t26\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Murrieta 2007 Finca Ygay Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarqués de Murrieta\tLT_90_Points\tCherry and raspberry aromas lead the charge, but as it airs out it becomes more raisiny and jammy smelling.

Hard, edgy and compact in feel, this tastes punchy, with a note of vinegar and plum skins to an otherwise black-fruit flavor profile.

It feels dilute at first, but more structure and body appear as the wine unfolds. The flavor of jammy raspberry is somewhat herbal, and the finish is light.\n102354\tSpain\tAlmodí Petit\t87\t12\tCatalonia\tTerra Alta\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAltavins 2015 Almodí Petit White (Terra Alta)\tWhite Blend\tAltavins\tLT_90_Points\tStony fresh aromas of lime and grapefruit are light and clean.

It feels pinched and narrow but lively, with mild berry, cherry and leather flavors. Holds onto that leathery characteristic on what amounts to a slightly bitter tasting finish.\n33795\tSpain\tAlmancenista José Luis González Obregón Amontillado del Puerto\t93\t30\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLustau NV Almancenista José Luis González Obregón Amontillado del Puerto Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tLustau\tGT_90_Points\tFlawless on the nose, this amontillado purchased from the solera of Señor González Obregón is full of lift, power and toffee on the nose. There's zero excess weight to the palate, which features flavors of nuts, salt, caramel and dried apricot. On the finish, a hint of buttered toast offers an umami offset to acid-driven raciness.\n32740\tSpain\tCeps Nous\t90\t22\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCeller Pasanau 2012 Ceps Nous Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tCeller Pasanau\tGT_90_Points\tDeep, pure blackberry, cassis and minerally aromas are fresh, clean and authentic for Priorat. This is bold, chunky and ripe, with an acidic streak that maintains clarity. Plum and blackberry flavors are a bit woody and herbal, while pepper, mint, menthol and berry flavors drive a flush, satisfying finish. Drink through 2018.\n58809\tSpain\t\t86\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMontevicor NV Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMontevicor\tLT_90_Points\tBready, dusty aromas of baked apple come across loud and chunky.

The palate feels entirely in sync, with fine tannins and lasting acidity. Layered, earthy plum and berry flavors are spicy and show notes of vanilla and tobacco prior to a smooth finish.

This is heavy, broad and a bit clumsy on the palate. Berry and prune flavors are solid but not overly fresh, while the finish is full and raisiny as it improves over time.\n86806\tSpain\tMinimum\t91\t65\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Rafael Cambra 2003 Minimum Monastrell (Valencia)\tMonastrell\tBodegas Rafael Cambra\tGT_90_Points\tFruit overload and gumball richness define the syrupy, super ripe nose on this Monastrell (Mourvèdre) Cabernet Franc blend from Valencia. This is big stuff, with blackberry, prune and chocolate cake qualities. It's thick, intense, tannic and will continue to be lively and drinkable for another six or seven years. A surprise wine; 100 cases produced.\n75464\tSpain\tWinemakers Select\t88\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Monistrol 2007 Winemakers Select Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMarques de Monistrol\tLT_90_Points\tLight, airy and dusty on the nose, with apple and melon along with a touch of yeast.

Not overly complex but deeply drawn and balanced. The plum, fresh raisin and blackberry flavors are smooth and structured, and overall flavor and liveliness are key attributes.

The palate is crisp and tight, with firm plum and berry fruit in front of a short, basic finish. A good, standard wine with good depth and character; 100% Tempranillo.\n119310\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t17\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tYuntero 2010 Crianza Red (La Mancha)\tTempranillo Blend\tYuntero\tLT_90_Points\tDusty black cherry and dark plum aromas are ripe and friendly. This is a plump, modern-style red with a clean mouthfeel and weight. Berry fruits, spice and oak flavors blend well, while the finish is, in general, full, smooth and adequately fresh. Tempranillo with 10% Petit Verdot.\n122565\tSpain\tFinca El Bosque\t95\t170\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSierra Cantabria 2009 Finca El Bosque  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tSierra Cantabria\tGT_90_Points\tEl Bosque is Eguren family top-shelf Rioja that's a knockout. It's dark as night, with dusty aromas of cola, cocoa, marzipan, blackberry and spice all rolled into a finessed whole. Feels tight as a drum but balanced, with monstrous flavors of boysenberry, cassis, peppercorn, baking spices and chocolate. Young and raring to go; hold until 2013 then drink through 2018.\n66926\tSpain\tTinus\t95\t600\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGarcía Figuero 2012 Tinus  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tGarcía Figuero\tGT_90_Points\tExtremely ripe aromas of prune, blackberry, cassis and cinnamon announce a jammy loaded palate that weighs nothing short of a ton. The flavor profile is a black-fruit bonanza accented by graphite and blackened toast. Drink this monster wine from a dry, hot vintage from 2019–2034.\n7062\tSpain\t\t84\t18\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVieira de Plata 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tVieira de Plata\tLT_90_Points\tAn oily bouquet lacks freshness while smelling a bit oxidized and like mushrooms. This has a chunky palate with oxidized, somewhat bitter flavors of papaya and citrus fruits. A pithy mildly bitter finish struggles to show its virtues.\n119185\tSpain\tWhite Label\t84\t8\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFaustino Rivero Ulecia 2013 White Label  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tFaustino Rivero Ulecia\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a spunky, jumpy Tempranillo with horsey aromas of cherry and plum. A light, fresh palate delivers lightly herbal flavors of plum and pie cherry, with an earthy twist. Mild and hollow on the finish.\n4420\tSpain\tBotani Old Vines\t89\t19\tAndalucia\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJorge Ordóñez & Co. 2016 Botani Old Vines Moscatel\tMoscatel\tJorge Ordóñez & Co.\tLT_90_Points\tA light color and classic aromas of white flowers, citrus blossom and wet stones open this dry Moscatel from Málaga. A lean, crisp palate with lime-like acidity deals flavors of lime, lychee and white pineapple. A low-volume but racy finish is fresh and tangy.\n94250\tSpain\tParaje de El Santo\t84\t69\tNorthern Spain\tTierra de León\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPricum 2007 Paraje de El Santo Prieto Picudo (Tierra de León)\tPrieto Picudo\tPricum\tLT_90_Points\tLemony and citrusy from the get-go, with floral notes to the nose. The palate is sheering and tart, with edgy tannins. As a whole, it's angular, with tomato and red-fruit flavors. A natural, jacked-up example of Prieto Picudo that's a bit underwhelming.\n97181\tSpain\tQuixote Merlot-Tempranillo-Petit Verdot\t81\t25\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPago Casa del Blanco 2005 Quixote Merlot-Tempranillo-Petit Verdot Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tRed Blend\tPago Casa del Blanco\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of cabbage, tomato leaf and green berry fruits tell you all you need to know. The wine is green but thick, with an unctuous meeting of sweet and underripe flavors as well as a gooey mouthfeel. Just one of a million weak wines from the high plains of Spain.\n3614\tSpain\tVendimia Seleccionada\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSembro 2009 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tSembro\tLT_90_Points\tScratchy and a little sharp smelling on first impression, with vanilla and milk chocolate aromas in addition to standard red fruit scents. Feels firm, solid and basic, with dark fruit flavors touched up by young, simple oak notes. Standard and dry on the finish.\n90423\tSpain\t\t88\t13\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCuatro Pasos 2012 Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tCuatro Pasos\tLT_90_Points\tIt has been a while since we've reviewed Cuatro Pasos, but eight vintages later it's basically the same wine, which, for the price, means good value. This opens with earthy warm muddled berry aromas. The palate is flush and plump, reflective of a hot vintage, while blackberry and cassis flavors finish hefty. Drink now.\n90867\tSpain\tSelección\t89\t16\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tIcono 2013 Selección Red (Valencia)\tRed Blend\tIcono\tLT_90_Points\tDark berry aromas, chocolate and grit define the nose on this blend of Syrah, Cabernet and Tempranillo. The palate feels ripe and fresh, but the tannins are hard and grabby. Black plum flavors are bold and offer notes of spice, herbs and earthiness. This is composed on the finish despite a reprise of hard smacking tannins.\n77546\tSpain\tBlés Crianza Organic Wine\t88\t19\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAranleón 2014 Blés Crianza Organic Wine Red (Valencia)\tRed Blend\tAranleón\tLT_90_Points\tFloral soupy plum aromas come with notes of road tar, violet, lavender and grass. This has a jammy, saturated, chunky mouthfeel to go with plum and spiced-berry flavors. Exotic notes of cardamom and clove are key to a spicy finish. This is a blend of Monastrell, Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon.\n5534\tSpain\tGarnatxa Blanca\t82\t17\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tZerran 2013 Garnatxa Blanca Garnacha Blanca (Montsant)\tGarnacha Blanca\tZerran\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of rubber and floor wax lack fruit and nuance. This has a high-acid, granular mouthfeel that lacks full cohesion. Waxy, salty flavors crowd out primary fruit flavors, while this finishes briny, high in acid and salty.\n15051\tSpain\tMelior\t89\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMatarromera 2009 Melior  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tMatarromera\tLT_90_Points\tBig and dark, with firm black cherry and blackberry aromas. Offers size, structure and crispness in the mouth, with driving, muscled flavors of cherry, black plum and integrated oak. Spicy and dry on the back end, with more than a hint of vanilla.\n119534\tSpain\t+7\t92\t35\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPinord 2010 +7 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tPinord\tGT_90_Points\tThis ripe, healthy wine offers aromas of baked black fruits, licorice and raisin. In the mouth, it's more vital than on the nose; racy acidity and firm but pure tannins make sure of that. For flavors, look for savory tomato, plum, berry fruits, licorice and schisty minerality. Finishing notes of mocha, plum and coffee are braced by hard-driving tannins. Drink through 2024.\n97421\tSpain\tUnico Reserva Especial\t92\t600\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVega Sicilia NV Unico Reserva Especial  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon\tVega Sicilia\tGT_90_Points\tThis blend of the 1996, '98 and '02 vintages is mature and browning in hue. The nose is superripe, with prune, brandied cherry, tobacco and molasses notes. A soft, creamy palate holds vanilla, tobacco, baking spice, prune and raisin flavors, while the finish is an echo of what came before. Excellent when judged in its own right, this doesn't quite compare with Vega's best wines. Drink through 2025.\n10170\tSpain\tPazo Cilleiro\t87\t20\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Muriel 2014 Pazo Cilleiro Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tBodegas Muriel\tLT_90_Points\tDon't let the gold color fool you, this is quite vital with floral, leesy, almost grassy aromas. Bracing acidity is at the core with clover, grass, quince and sour-apricot flavors. Blasting acidity is a force on the finish.\n56124\tSpain\tAbadía de San Campio\t89\t20\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTerras Gauda 2016 Abadía de San Campio Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tTerras Gauda\tLT_90_Points\tModerately floral aromas of stone fruits and fresh carrot juice feed into a round palate that's balanced and well shaped. Nectarine and peach flavors are nice and easy. This wine is slightly leesy-tasting on a medium-length finish.\n70666\tSpain\tBiberius\t86\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tComenge 2012 Biberius  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tComenge\tLT_90_Points\tRoasted, leathery and earthy aromas of red berry fruits settle on a stewed note. The palate is grabby and raw, with tomato-like acidity. Flavors of savory, barbecued fruit suggest grilled red plum and tomato, while the finish is woody and salty.\n60817\tSpain\tPremium Pedro Ximénez\t87\t25\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDelgado Zuleta NV Premium Pedro Ximénez Pedro Ximénez (Jerez)\tPedro Ximénez\tDelgado Zuleta\tLT_90_Points\tSimple brown sugar scents make for a monotone bouquet. Creamy and thick on the palate, this PX tastes largely of maple syrup and toffee. Overall, it delivers sweetness and toffee notes but not much complexity.\n121420\tSpain\tGran Coronas Reserva\t88\t24\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTorres 2008 Gran Coronas Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Penedès)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tTorres\tLT_90_Points\tNotes of baked-berry, herb and savory spice come together well on the bouquet. It feels chunky and round but lively, with plum and cassis flavors that carry an herbal, tomatoey shading. This is fresh and herbal enough so that you know it's Old World.\n100451\tSpain\tPecunia\t84\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCampos Góticos 2004 Pecunia  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tCampos Góticos\tLT_90_Points\tLeathery and peanutty on the nose; soon the aromas expand to baked plum and stewy berries. The palate is sturdy and tannic, but there's enough flesh and weight to the fruit that it's mostly balanced.

Feels thick, but there's enough acidity to cut through the wine's weight. Flavors of caramel and chocolate are ideal, and the finish is smooth, not heavy, and has bounce in its step. A beautiful PX any way you cut it.\n14733\tSpain\t\t81\t45\tNorthern Spain\tEmpordà\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOliver Conti 2005 Red (Empordà)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tOliver Conti\tLT_90_Points\tDisappointing given the price and how good Conti's white wines can be. This is leafy and piercing on the nose, then heavy and super tannic and growling on the palate. Tastes leafy, herbal and earthy.\n3919\tSpain\tOld Vines\t87\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNisia 2014 Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tNisia\tLT_90_Points\tApple, peach and melon aromas are clean and fruity. The palate on this Verdejo is melony, which matches the wine's melon and papaya flavors. On the finish, a note of apple cider is detectable. Because of moderate acidity and some flab, it's advisable to drink this now.\n51898\tSpain\tDon PX Reserva Especial\t93\t258\tAndalucia\tMontilla-Moriles\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Toro Albala, SL 1947 Don PX Reserva Especial Pedro Ximénez (Montilla-Moriles)\tPedro Ximénez\tBodegas Toro Albala, SL\tGT_90_Points\tThis gorgeous dessert wine shows a coffee-colored tint that's backed by lush, deep aromas of fig, caramel, toffee and prune. The palate shows weight but a refined mouthfeel that's not sticky or heavy. Flavors of coffee, mocha, chocolate, caramel, peanut brittle and prune finish warm and long. Only 43 cases made.\n15671\tSpain\tGranja Gran Reserva\t94\t95\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRemelluri 2011 Granja Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tRemelluri\tGT_90_Points\tAlluring aromas of tree bark, licorice root, rose petal and ripe black fruit show elegance. This is a touch grippy and young in feel, but overall it's showing balance. Deep flavors of plum, cherry, wild berry and vanilla finish finessed by a balance of weight and acidity. Drink from 2019–2032.\n18419\tSpain\tDos\t91\t25\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRafael Cambra 2007 Dos Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Valencia)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Merlot\tRafael Cambra\tGT_90_Points\tAromas of kirsch, licorice, mineral and blackberry are strapping as they lead onto a balanced, flowing palate with flavors of black fruit, spice and chocolate.

This is pulpy in feel with a vague focus. Leesy, pithy citrus flavors are standard and short on personality, while this finishes adequately with a mild citric lift.\n121485\tSpain\tReserva\t87\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDinastía Vivanco 2004 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tDinastía Vivanco\tLT_90_Points\tDusty earth and dry spice aromas blend with some char, vanilla and berry/cherry on the nose.

It feels fresh, crisp and alert, with cherry tomato, berry fruit, tobacco and vanilla flavors. This feels healthy but not real deep or complex on the finish.\n74951\tSpain\tEdición Limitada\t88\t25\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPríncipe de Viana 2011 Edición Limitada Red (Navarra)\tRed Blend\tPríncipe de Viana\tLT_90_Points\tPlum, tobacco and cheesy aromas register as spicy and rustic on the nose. A raw, hard-tannin palate offers herbal flavors of thyme and rosemary to go with chocolate and raspberry notes. Toasty oak, heat and length on the finish suggest that this may improve over the next five years.\n36522\tSpain\t\t81\t9\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLove 2015 Moscato (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tMoscato\tLove\tLT_90_Points\tBland, sweet aromas are not persuasive. This feels cloying and sticky due to a lot of sugar and not much acidity. Soapy, sweet flavors finish with bitter notes.\n88598\tSpain\tBrunus\t87\t28\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPortal del Montsant 2010 Brunus Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tPortal del Montsant\tLT_90_Points\tBerry and cherry aromas are fruity and clean. This blend of Carignan, Grenache and Syrah is big on the palate but also tannic, acidic and fierce. Black plum, blackberry and tomato flavors finish crisp and firm.\n3358\tSpain\tConde de Valdemar Old Vines\t84\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Valdemar 2010 Conde de Valdemar Old Vines  (Rioja)\tGarnacha\tBodegas Valdemar\tLT_90_Points\tRaisiny, pruny aromas are all that register on this rubbery, jammy Garnacha.

The mouthfeel is acceptable, while the flavor profile seems caught between sweet lime and lychee and bitterness.\n84006\tSpain\tTérmino de Arriba\t88\t20\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tHilanda 2012 Término de Arriba Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tHilanda\tLT_90_Points\tPowerful berry and spice aromas open this jammy slightly heavy Monastell. Desert-herb notes of sage and thyme accent a core blueberry flavor, while this tastes of carob, roasted beet and toast on the finish.\n83909\tSpain\t\t83\t10\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLegado Muñoz 2009 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo\tLegado Muñoz\tLT_90_Points\tJammy aromas mix with grassy green notes in front of a sweet, chunky palate that offers unconvincing, generic berry flavors. Devoid of elegance and character but loaded with heft and baked fruit. A sweet, rudimentary wine.\n68541\tSpain\t\t86\t9\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLas Valles 2011 Viura-Chardonnay (Cariñena)\tViura-Chardonnay\tLas Valles\tLT_90_Points\tLight lemon-lime aromas open things up, alongside a light mineral note. The palate is clean and racy, with enough body to hold up to core flavors of lime, kiwi and green apple. A floral freshness carries the finish.\n113000\tSpain\tMaceración Carbónica\t86\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Ontañón 2013 Maceración Carbónica  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Ontañón\tLT_90_Points\tBright, bouncy aromas of cherry and pomegranate are mild, dusty and typical of a carbonic macerated Tempranillo. This feels chewy and plump, but simple. Medicinal cherry and raspberry flavors are spunky on the finish.\n71330\tSpain\tGlorioso Gran Reserva\t87\t36\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Palacio 2007 Glorioso Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Palacio\tLT_90_Points\tStalky, soupy berry aromas come up shy on elegance. This feels clampy and hard with rocky tannins. Standard berry fruit flavors are overshadowed by gritty stalky blackened accents, while the finish is grating and uncushioned but long.\n28352\tSpain\tBarrel Fermented\t89\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuga 2015 Barrel Fermented White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tMuga\tLT_90_Points\tStone-fruit and melon aromas are minerally. This feels linear and tight due to racy acidity. Flavors of white fruits, lime and stones are slightly tart, while this is short but firm on the finish. For barrel-fermented Viura, this is not oaky in any overt way.\n54351\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t88\t22\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca del Marquesado 2003 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tFinca del Marquesado\tLT_90_Points\tMature, earthy and soft on the nose, with roasted, spicy, integrated berry aromas. Full but baked feeling, with maturity and monotone flavors of sweet berries that don't vary. It remains roasted and warm on the finish. Drink soon.\n18385\tSpain\tBlanc\t88\t20\tCatalonia\tTerra Alta\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJaspi 2012 Blanc White (Terra Alta)\tWhite Blend\tJaspi\tLT_90_Points\tMinerally lime and peach-pit aromas set up a crisp, stony, elegant palate with lees-based flavors of vanilla that are softly matched by melon and papaya. Fresh and not too demanding, it's made from 70% Garnatxa Blanca and 30% Macabeo (Viura).\n112231\tSpain\tAlcanta Barrique Oak Aged\t84\t14\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBocopa 2013 Alcanta Barrique Oak Aged Tempranillo (Alicante)\tTempranillo\tBocopa\tLT_90_Points\tForced oak and grassy core aromas make for a challenging, slightly green and resiny bouquet. This feels thick and heavy, with oaky, stewy flavors of ripe raspberry and black plum.\n98303\tSpain\tOld Vines\t88\t35\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Gitana 2014 Old Vines  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tLa Gitana\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy, minty, herbal black-fruit aromas blend with a note of grass. This wine feels plump and grabby, with hard edges. Modest but solid black-fruit flavors are toasty but short, while the finish offers blackened spice notes and grapy flavors as it dissipates.\n13393\tSpain\t\t86\t17\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y León\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Pensador 2009 Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)\tVerdejo\tEl Pensador\tLT_90_Points\tA solid rendition of Verdejo with apple and pear aromas along with basic minerality. The palate is standard and firm, with good acidity pushing apple and citrus flavors. Perfectly competent but not showing the nuances and higher qualities that would justify a $17 outlay.\n101379\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t15\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa de la Ermita 2013 Crianza Red (Jumilla)\tRed Blend\tCasa de la Ermita\tLT_90_Points\tFloral berry and plum aromas are lightly woody. This feels full and edgy, with fairly hard tannins. Black-fruit flavors are certainly ripe, while this finishes bold and intense, with scratchy tannins. The blend is Monastrell, Tempranillo and Cab Sauvignon.\n1306\tSpain\tChateldon Reserva\t89\t20\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPinord 2007 Chateldon Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Penedès)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tPinord\tLT_90_Points\tRusty in color and earthy on the nose, with capped aromas of cedar and herbs, this mature Catalonian Cabernet is compact on the palate and fused by firm tannins. Flavors of dried berry, stone fruits and toffee finish long. This ranks as a fun challenge for Spanish wine geeks.\n16031\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t88\t22\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca del Marquesado 2003 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tFinca del Marquesado\tLT_90_Points\tMature, earthy and soft on the nose, with roasted, spicy, integrated berry aromas.

This feels chunky but largely healthy, while oaky minty flavors of berry fruits and plum show a tomato-like quality on a blocky finish.\n39851\tSpain\t\t87\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Eguía 2015 Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tViña Eguía\tLT_90_Points\tBasic apple aromas are fresh and clean.

This is chunky and heavyset, but comfortable across the palate. Generic plum and berry flavors are pure, while this finishes plump, chunky and with a hint of chocolate.\n50025\tSpain\t\t85\t9\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPaso a Paso 2012 Verdejo (La Mancha)\tVerdejo\tPaso a Paso\tLT_90_Points\tSlightly mealy aromas of melon and papaya set up an easygoing, creamy palate, with green banana and nectarine flavors. A plump, fairly balanced finish ensures that this quaffer makes it to the finish line in decent shape. Drink immediately.\n26055\tSpain\t\t84\t15\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLelia 2014 Garnacha (Cariñena)\tGarnacha\tLelia\tLT_90_Points\tBaked aromas of raisin, prune and black cherry are also oaky.

Flavors of baked berries and marshmallow finish with a note of chocolate and a grabby, heavy feel.\n60063\tSpain\t\t86\t10\tNorthern Spain\tSomontano\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViñas del Vero 2016 Chardonnay (Somontano)\tChardonnay\tViñas del Vero\tLT_90_Points\tLight, pleasant apple aromas are about all this neutral Chardonnay is giving. Its mild palate with just enough acidity carries clean and easy melon flavors. A slightly briny note closes out the lean finish.\n3392\tSpain\tXA\t84\t14\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlbet I Noya 2014 XA Xarel-lo (Penedès)\tXarel-lo\tAlbet I Noya\tLT_90_Points\tBland aromas suggest applesauce. This varietal Xarello feels plump but flat. Candied, generic white-fruit flavors are nonspecific, while this offers up citrus notes and pyrazines on the finish.\n111606\tSpain\tAmontillado\t90\t15\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Amontillado Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tBodegas Dios Baco S.L.\tGT_90_Points\tFor affordable amontillado, this is downright excellent. Smells nutty and oily, maybe a touch sharp, but well within normal parameters. Feels fresh, round and comfortable, with lots of core fruit flavor, nuttiness, sweet toffee and caramel. Finishes with toasted pecan flavors and peanut butter notes. Semidry in style.\n102967\tSpain\tAquilon\t93\t168\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlto Moncayo 2013 Aquilon Garnacha (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha\tAlto Moncayo\tGT_90_Points\tSmoky, roasted aromas of hickory and blackberry are patented for this label: all Alto Moncayo top-end bottlings open like this. In the mouth, this is direct, full bodied and high in energy. The flavors match the nose, meaning this tastes like dark berry fruits mixed with smoky oak and char, while the finish turns chocolaty, with pepper, wild berry, spice notes and heat. Drink through 2022.\n75498\tSpain\tBrut Gran Reserva\t87\t50\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJuvé y Camps 2008 Brut Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tJuvé y Camps\tLT_90_Points\tWith lemon-lime and lemongrass aromas, this Cava is slightly exotic on the bouquet. The palate feels good but not terribly interesting or complex, with flavors of dusty apple, peach and vanilla. With a short finish, this vintage sparkler is fine but not as good as in the past.\n128368\tSpain\t7 Varietales\t94\t75\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio de Berzal 2011 7 Varietales  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tDominio de Berzal\tGT_90_Points\tConcentrated, inky and charred on the nose, this is a ripe and heady Rioja with strong barrel influences. Blackberry, cassis and roasted black-plum flavors are appropriate given the wine's hefty build. Finishing flavors of coffee, bitter chocolate and baking spices are long and thorough. Drink this powerful Tempranillo-led blend through 2030.\n119928\tSpain\tVendimia Seleccionada\t90\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAnier 2013 Vendimia Seleccionada Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tAnier\tGT_90_Points\tClean, green and not at all mean is how to best describe the aromas on this pure Verdejo. The mouthfeel is citric and crystalline. Flavors of citrus fruits, particularly lemon and lime, show a hint of matchstick sulfur, while the finish is the slightest bit nutty in flavor. Drink immediately.\n101391\tSpain\tBrut Nature Gran Reserva Cava\t88\t15\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSumarroca 2005 Brut Nature Gran Reserva Cava Sparkling (Penedès)\tSparkling Blend\tSumarroca\tLT_90_Points\tDry, pure and attractive on the nose, with crisp apple and lemon-lime flavors. This wine performs on an even keel from start to finish, and it's dry, tangy and correct as far as brut nature cavas go. Verges on elegant.\n75211\tSpain\tLa Atalaya\t87\t16\tCentral Spain\tAlmansa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAtalaya 2011 La Atalaya Red (Almansa)\tRed Blend\tAtalaya\tLT_90_Points\tRoasted aromas of berry and hickory come with tons of char and BBQ notes. This is thick, almost to the point of being syrupy, while flavors of herbs, blackberry, creamy oak and mint are more savory than bright. If this were any more rich and oaky, it might be considered too fat and heavy.\n54337\tSpain\tTerrer d'Aubert\t90\t40\tCatalonia\tTarragona\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVinyes del Terrer 2010 Terrer d'Aubert Red (Tarragona)\tRed Blend\tVinyes del Terrer\tGT_90_Points\tThis Catalonian blend is a concentrated number with a narrow, fruit-forward nose and cheesy leather on the side. The palate is full, grabby and ripe; flavors of blackberry and cassis are jammy and dark. It finishes sweet in flavor and ultraripe in feel, with a syrupy aftertaste. Another year or two in bottle will help this settle down; drink through 2020.\n71474\tSpain\tCoto de Imaz Gran Reserva\t89\t45\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Coto 2004 Coto de Imaz Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tEl Coto\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of leather, dried cherry, vanilla and leafy earthiness get this gran reserva moving.

Drink now.\n50023\tSpain\tFinca Los Cerrillos Roble\t85\t16\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMontalvo Wilmot 2008 Finca Los Cerrillos Roble Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon\tMontalvo Wilmot\tLT_90_Points\tScratchy red-berry aromas are herbal but not fully green. This has a lively, raw, choppy mouthfeel and flavors of herbal red berry and thyme. On the finish, it reverts to dry and scratchy.\n108081\tSpain\tGotes\t86\t23\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPortal del Priorat 2014 Gotes Grenache Blanc (Priorat)\tGrenache Blanc\tPortal del Priorat\tLT_90_Points\tApple and pear aromas are dusty and leesy. This varietal white Grenache feels linear, with no up or down to the mouthfeel. Flavors of citrus fruits and mango finish lean, crisp and minerally, with lemony acidity.\n112456\tSpain\tCrianza Selección\t89\t16\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBorsao 2007 Crianza Selección Red (Campo de Borja)\tRed Blend\tBorsao\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a really good example of a blended wine from Aragón. It's 50% Garnacha with 25% each Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon, and thus it is more complex and interesting than your run-of-the-mill varietal Grenache. Mellow aromas of ripe fruit and spice open things up, followed by balanced flavors of berry fruits, vanilla and cream. Easygoing and highly recommended for the price.\n60508\tSpain\tGran Familia\t84\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo de Fuenmayor NV Gran Familia  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tCastillo de Fuenmayor\tLT_90_Points\tRooty berry and coffee aromas are medicinal. This feels punchy due to stark acidity. Flavors of oaky red plum and currant finish similarly, and while this Rioja isn't bothersome it's raw throughout.\n99893\tSpain\t6 Meses en Barrica\t82\t14\tCentral Spain\tUclés\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca La Estacada 2010 6 Meses en Barrica Tempranillo (Uclés)\tTempranillo\tFinca La Estacada\tLT_90_Points\tIntersting up front, with savory, roasted aromas of smoky plum and barbecue. It feels bullish and punishing, bearing monster tannins and heavy extraction, with a roasted, charred flavor that leads to an all-out resiny, burnt-wood-tasting finish.\n5335\tSpain\tOld Vines\t87\t11\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tStylo 2008 Old Vines Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tStylo\tLT_90_Points\tWith full black-cherry and bacon aromas, this affordable wine comes across well on the nose. Thick and full-bodied in the mouth, this has flavors of blackberry, creamy oak, chocolate and vanilla. It feels broad and just bright enough on the finish.\n41253\tSpain\tTermes\t91\t30\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNumanthia 2008 Termes  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tNumanthia\tGT_90_Points\tAn excellent wine for an off vintage, with licorice, balsam, black fruit galore and coconut aromas. The feel is plush, layered and smooth for Toro, with blackberry, mocha, lemon peel and coconutty flavors. Toasty on the finish, with a final wave of vanilla and chocolate. Drink now through 2014.\n22598\tSpain\tElite\t89\t33\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPradorey 2011 Elite  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinta Fina\tPradorey\tLT_90_Points\tGritty, rubbery aromas seem underripe given how warm and generous 2011 was. In the mouth, this is gravelly and like sandpaper. Burnt gritty berry flavors are saucy, while this tastes of herbal berry fruits and oak on the finish.\n98556\tSpain\tCastillo Ygay Gran Reserva Especial\t95\t89\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Murrieta 2005 Castillo Ygay Gran Reserva Especial  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tMarqués de Murrieta\tGT_90_Points\tSuperb at every checkpoint, this is a world-class wine. Cherry, cassis and earth aromas are spicy and mellow, not bullish or loud. This feels creamy but with enough textural grit to keep things lively, while flavors of vanilla, tobacco and plum are nicely integrated. A mild, medium-long finish epitomizes elegance. Drink now through 2025.\n19117\tSpain\tBarrel Fermented\t87\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSonsierra 2015 Barrel Fermented Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tSonsierra\tLT_90_Points\tWhile this smells almost entirely like a barrel, the palate avoids being resiny and instead comes across as fresh and balanced. Oaky flavors are unavoidable, while melony fruit notes on the finish are dosed up with wood spice and a shot of freshening acidity.\n60688\tSpain\tCrianza\t89\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBeronia 2012 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBeronia\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy herbal plum and currant aromas are light and a touch minty. This is easygoing and fresh with a medium-size body. Flavors of cherry and raspberry are lightly herbal, with light oak that adds a lactic note to a berry driven finish. Drink through 2017.\n53689\tSpain\tBrut Nature Gran Reserva\t90\t37\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMaria Casanovas 2014 Brut Nature Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMaria Casanovas\tGT_90_Points\tYeasty, bready aromas reflect time in the bottle, although for a gran reserva this is still young. Depth and cushion are present on a slightly foamy palate, while this wine is less about ripe fruit flavors and more about sourdough and fermented citrus notes prior to a lasting finish.\n117953\tSpain\tTable Wine\t84\t12\tSpain Other\tVino de Mesa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tKurmisti 2007 Table Wine Hondarrabi Zuri (Vino de Mesa)\tHondarrabi Zuri\tKurmisti\tLT_90_Points\tClear as crystal up front, and then come flavors of lemon and green apple. There is almost no overt sweetness to it; it's quite acidic and sharp, which is common for the Hondarrabi Zuri grape from Northern Spain. As might be expected, green apple and lime control the austere finish. Good but very narrow in scope.\n111309\tSpain\t\t89\t20\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCruz Montesa 2009 Red (Alicante)\tRed Blend\tCruz Montesa\tLT_90_Points\tMossy, earthy and damp smelling, this has roasted plum and berry aromas that suggest savory things to come. It feels rich, with good acidity and a thick overall texture. Saucy plum, berry, tomato and herb flavors finish with barbecue, vanilla and tobacco accents. This is a blend of Monastrell, Syrah and Tempranillo, with 500 cases produced.\n107264\tSpain\tHacienda de ArínzanoRosé\t84\t20\tNorthern Spain\tPago de Arínzano\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArínzano 2015 Hacienda de ArínzanoRosé Tempranillo (Pago de Arínzano)\tTempranillo\tArínzano\tLT_90_Points\tMild citrus and stone-fruit aromas include a note of crushed vitamin. This bright-pink rosé is wide but citric on the palate, with mild nectarine and white-grape flavors. On the finish, this is round in feel without much flavor.\n6509\tSpain\tBarrica\t81\t29\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAltos de Torona 2013 Barrica Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tAltos de Torona\tLT_90_Points\tOxidized apricot aromas comprise the bulk of the nose on this weird oak-aged Albariño. Flavors of apricot, peach pit and quince quickly turn bitter, while the finish is flabby. Overall this is sketchy, with few attributes.\n91849\tSpain\tClos Abella\t95\t90\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarco Abella 2010 Clos Abella Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tMarco Abella\tGT_90_Points\tMagnetic aromas of woodsy spice, fine cedar and pure berry fruits are singing a pretty song. This is fresh, ripped and juicy on the palate, with zero excess weight. Rooty, earthy, woodsy blackberry and cassis flavors finish long and with fig, chocolate and toast notes. Hold this world-class red for a few more years, if possible. Drink through 2025.\n25542\tSpain\tTorroja\t92\t50\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTerroir Al Límit 2015 Torroja Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tTerroir Al Límit\tGT_90_Points\tRose and violet aromas sit comfortably with tight, gritty cherry and plum scents. A tight medium-to-full palate is the staging ground for fresh plum and berry flavors that are powerful but not heavy. A long, warming finish maintains the wine's core potency. This is not ready to drink; best from 2019–2028.\n123385\tSpain\tSingle Vineyard Estate Bottled\t89\t20\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Arantei 2014 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tFinca Arantei\tLT_90_Points\tDusty aromas of melon and apple smell a bit leesy. This feels round and complete, while melon, citrus and apple flavors turn more briny on the finish, where a saline quality takes over. Overall, this is bright and right. Drink now.\n114073\tSpain\t\t85\t22\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRectoral do Umia 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tRectoral do Umia\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of lees and buttercup come with a hint of tropical fruit. This fading, Albariño is plump and generic in feel, without much cut or minerality. Melon, apple and pithy citrus flavors finish similarly, with mild bitterness.\n5993\tSpain\tBlanc\t87\t18\tCatalonia\tTerra Alta\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCeller Bàrbara Forés 2014 Blanc Garnacha Blanca (Terra Alta)\tGarnacha Blanca\tCeller Bàrbara Forés\tLT_90_Points\tLeesy vanilla aromas give this Garnacha Blanca a cookie-like nose. Plump and round across the palate, this tastes pithy like citrus peel, with a mildly bitter aftertaste. A simple finish doesn't offer anything new.\n287\tSpain\tBraó Vinyes Velles\t92\t40\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAcústic 2010 Braó Vinyes Velles Carignan-Grenache (Montsant)\tCarignan-Grenache\tAcústic\tGT_90_Points\tThis is the stud in the Acústic stable. A blend of 70% Carignan and 30% Garnacha, Braó is lively and bright on the nose, with ripe blackberry and cassis aromas. The palate is concentrated and juicy, with fine balance and bold flavors of blueberry, blackberry and coffee. A toasty, dark finish features chocolate, toast and minerality. Drink through 2019.\n88428\tSpain\tPagos de Viña Real\t93\t110\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCVNE 2012 Pagos de Viña Real  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tCVNE\tGT_90_Points\tCompelling aromas of dry herbs blend with ripe berry, plum and leathery scents. This feels tight, juicy and ripped with raw, hard-pumping acidity. Flavors of currant, plum and cherry run deep, while the finish is presently youthful, grabby and drawing, with a slight note of raisin. Drink through 2032.\n51792\tSpain\tAndión\t86\t16\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Núñez 2014 Andión Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tBodegas Núñez\tLT_90_Points\tRound, creamy apple aromas open things up. This is melony and soft in feel, with flavors of cider, lemon and lychee. A tropical-leaning finish is solid but suggestive of a wine in decline. Drink immediately.\n68624\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t85\t20\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCodorníu NV Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tCodorníu\tLT_90_Points\tStony, distant aromas of lemon-lime open this Chardonnay Cava. Condensed and fairly narrow on the palate, this tastes savory, saucy, briny and like cider and citrus juice. A briny tasting, minerally feeling finish is low on fruit flavor and plays up saucy green notes.\n19281\tSpain\tJME\t87\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Muriel 2007 JME  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Muriel\tLT_90_Points\tSpicy and jumpy on the nose, with pine and juniper notes coming alongside more normal berry and cherry scents. The palate has a severe snappy, citrusy, narrow feel and flavors of cherry, red plum and cherry tomato. Lightly herbal and oaky on the finish, with good length.\n12895\tSpain\tMonte Real Reserva\t91\t27\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Riojanas 2004 Monte Real Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Riojanas\tGT_90_Points\tRipe and leaning to the dark fruit side, with spicy blackberry aromas. Feels round and complete as it unfolds, and not at all edgy. Flavors of plum, cocoa and spice come with toasty oak, and the finish is bright and snappy. Will age for another decade without much trouble, but it's more than drinkable now.\n73647\tSpain\tReal de Aragón Centenaria\t89\t26\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPagos Familia Langa 2011 Real de Aragón Centenaria Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tPagos Familia Langa\tLT_90_Points\tFlush, jammy, spicy, peppery aromas are good and fruity. This is full and tight on the palate, with hard tannins. Flavors of plum, berry, vanilla and wood resin finish with a pinched, rubbery feel. This needs food in order to soften the texture.\n75555\tSpain\tCarta Nevada Brut\t80\t7\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\t\t\tFreixenet NV Carta Nevada Brut  (Penedès)\tChampagne Blend\tFreixenet\tLT_90_Points\tThis affordable sparkler starts off with odd, funky aromas that suggest bananas and mushy papaya. The flavors aren’t bad, but the wine is austere and awkward, with a rough texture that offers little pleasure. It’s just drinkable.\n79238\tSpain\tMediodía\t87\t12\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tInurrieta 2013 Mediodía Rosado (Navarra)\tRosado\tInurrieta\tLT_90_Points\tRaspberry and cherry aromas introduce this pink-tinted rosé. A chewy, full palate feels round and balanced, while flavors of briny berry and cherry finish bouncy and good, with a touch of residual sweetness. Drink now.\n33313\tSpain\tFaristol\t84\t14\tCatalonia\tTerra Alta\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCovilalba 2005 Faristol Garnacha (Terra Alta)\tGarnacha\tCovilalba\tLT_90_Points\tThe first couple of passes are not that encouraging: there's strawberry Kool-Aid and sharp field-like aromas of thistle and bramble. But the palate is not bad at all; it is flush yet racy, with solid raspberry and plum flavors that carry onto the finish. Not a refined wine but a natural one.\n7231\tSpain\t\t87\t16\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSenda 66 2010 Tempranillo (La Mancha)\tTempranillo\tSenda 66\tLT_90_Points\tThis is an exotic wine with aromas of graham cracker, blueberry, violet petal and pastry. It feels lush, grabby, chewy and tannic, with heavy flavors of clove, black licorice, savory berry and baked plum. The finish is dominated by oak, with clove and resiny barrel notes that compete with the wine's fresher dark-fruit component.\n45468\tSpain\tNoble\t93\t162\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGarcía Figuero 2011 Noble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tGarcía Figuero\tGT_90_Points\tMaple-tinged oak aromas are huge and frame equally massive black-fruit scents. A tight clampy palate needs time to soften and expand; it's hard and unyielding now. Flavors of black fruits, coffee, chocolate and heavy oak finish firm and peppery, with a reprise of grabby, grating tannins. Drink from 2020 through 2030.\n86801\tSpain\tCrianza\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Nueva 2006 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tFinca Nueva\tLT_90_Points\tGrapey and potent as Rioja crianzas go, with a medium-to-full-sized palate that's full of bright acidity and standard but solid berry fruit flavors. It's the slightest bit creamy and thick on the finish, but overall it's about as middle of the road as any wine on the market.\n96145\tSpain\tPrivat Orbus\t92\t50\tCatalonia\tAlella\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlta Alella 2013 Privat Orbus Syrah (Alella)\tSyrah\tAlta Alella\tGT_90_Points\tDeep, earthy, ripe aromas of blackberry, cola and asphalt are potent. This varietal Syrah from Catalonia is fleshy and wide across the palate, with tannic grip and structure. Satisfying, lusty flavors of raspberry, plum and cassis come with peppery spice in front of a meaty, firm finish. Drink 2017–2023.\n49616\tSpain\t\t90\t142\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Nido 2006 Red (Jumilla)\tCabernet Blend\tEl Nido\tGT_90_Points\tThere's no denying the wine's power and intensity. It's concentrated like a cement block, with richness, plummy aromas, sweetness and char. But it's also candied and ultrarich in the mouth, with syrupy flavors of berry extract, cola and chocolate. A heavy wine that shows every ounce of its 15.5% alcohol. Ultimately it's more sweet and powerful than it is precise. Drink now through 2013.\n9363\tSpain\tSeñorio del Cid Crianza\t84\t21\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOsborne Selección 2003 Señorio del Cid Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tOsborne Selección\tLT_90_Points\tOsborne is now in Ribera del Duero, and if this wine is an indication of what to expect, then work needs to be done. It has a cheesey nose with no real fruit character. The palate has acidic freshness but also a dearth of substance and a grabby feel. It's not bad wine per se, but in RDD the competition is stiff and this isn't going to draw many converts.\n92309\tSpain\t\t84\t14\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRibota 2013 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo\tRibota\tLT_90_Points\tDistinct aromas of Graham Cracker, coffee and stewed berries precede a tannic, rock-hard palate. Chunky, wayward flavors of blackberry and stalky black plum are earthy and finish with severe tannic grab.\n60939\tSpain\tFincas de Ganuza Reserva\t91\t48\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRemírez de Ganuza 2004 Fincas de Ganuza Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tRemírez de Ganuza\tGT_90_Points\tRound, stylish and wholesome on the nose, with wild berry, smoke, spice and not too much obvious oak. The palate is racy and forward, but also offers subtleties including dry fruit, spice, fresh tomato and wild herbs such as thyme and sage. Long and warm on the finish, with vanilla. Drink now through 2015.\n9960\tSpain\t\t87\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tParamus 2013 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tParamus\tLT_90_Points\tLeesy mango and lime aromas are fleshy, but attractive. A plump, juicy palate is holding its own, while flavors of pithy orange and melon end in a friendly, round fashion.\n115424\tSpain\t\t87\t17\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLagar de Indra 2016 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tLagar de Indra\tLT_90_Points\tFresh white-fruit aromas are pure in their set up of a citric, racy palate. Salty orange leads to a briny finish with salty apple and citrus flavors.\n60182\tSpain\tPalacio de Arganza Tempranillo-Mencia\t88\t22\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y León\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVinos de Arganza 2012 Palacio de Arganza Tempranillo-Mencia Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)\tRed Blend\tVinos de Arganza\tLT_90_Points\tDark aromas of asphalt, lead pencil, blackberry, toast and lemony oak lead to a raring, zesty palate with toasty, racy cherry and currant flavors. Spicy oak flavors and tingling acidity make for a lively finish.\n14761\tSpain\tEmbruix\t90\t27\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVall Llach 2014 Embruix Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tVall Llach\tGT_90_Points\tSchist, cola, cassis, berry and tobacco aroma cover all the bases in this wine. It's grippy and chewy but complete. Dark, earthy mulled berry flavors precede a tannic, pulpy finish with lasting plum and cassis notes. Drink through 2021.\n105240\tSpain\t\t90\t17\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNessa 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tNessa\tGT_90_Points\tCider and acacia aromas are subtle and inviting. This has a round yet citrusy feel along with flavors of nectarine and orange. A steady, smooth, minerally finish with just enough pulp and weight makes for a fine ending. Drink now.\n6437\tSpain\tTermanthia\t95\t200\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNumanthia 2009 Termanthia  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tNumanthia\tGT_90_Points\tThis Toro wine is a mindblower. The nose is exemplary: it bursts with smooth, rooty aromas of licorice, kirsch and roasted black plum. The palate is huge and tannic but luxurious, and the flavors of tobacco, cedar, lemon peel, spice and black fruit set up a finish with espresso, black cherry and a wall of tannins. Drink now through 2018.\n92325\tSpain\t\t89\t25\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPazo de Señorans 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tPazo de Señorans\tLT_90_Points\tSlightly leesy, oily aromas are mature, with notes of salami, apple and melon popping up. The palate is lush and round, with good acidity keeping things vertical. Leesy flavors of melon, vanilla, spiced apple and brine finish chunky, with moderate complexity.\n78249\tSpain\t\t87\t12\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Antigua 2006 Garnacha (La Mancha)\tGarnacha\tFinca Antigua\tLT_90_Points\tDark and savory more than jumpy and candied, and with that this is more serious than most everyday Spanish Garnachas. The palate is pumped up and ripe, with dark berry, black plum and licorice flavors. Along the way a hint of herb and tomato are noticeable, but for the most part this is well-comported, round-bodied Grenache.\n56114\tSpain\tCrianza\t89\t50\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPagos de Valcerracin 2013 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tPagos de Valcerracin\tLT_90_Points\tFig and raisin aromas blend with damp earth and animal notes on the nose of this grippy, bumpy crianza lacks focus but is still quite good. Black cherry, herbal plum and toasty oak flavors finish sticky and with lasting oak. Drink through 2025.\n57417\tSpain\t\t88\t9\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tWrongo Dongo 2010 Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tWrongo Dongo\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of pointed red plum and mild earthy, leafy aromas precede a well-constructed palate, with dark plum and standard berry flavors. This is a mellow wine that's very good for the price.\n111648\tSpain\tOld Vines\t87\t8\tCatalonia\tCatalunya\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRessò 2016 Old Vines Garnacha Blanca (Catalunya)\tGarnacha Blanca\tRessò\tLT_90_Points\tTan in color, with uncomplicated but friendly melon and apple aromas, this feels electric on the palate due to high acidity. The mix of citrus and stone-fruit flavors is lean, tight and lasting on the finish.\n45165\tSpain\tRosado\t85\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tIlurce 2008 Rosado Rosé (Rioja)\tRosé\tIlurce\tLT_90_Points\tReddish in color, with raspberry and other high-toned aromas. The palate is fleshy but clean, with good acidity pushing slightly sweet cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes with sugar and a good mouthfeel. Gets the job done.\n10712\tSpain\tTeso Blanco\t84\t22\tCentral Spain\tSierra de Salamanca\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Zorra 2014 Teso Blanco White (Sierra de Salamanca)\tWhite Blend\tLa Zorra\tLT_90_Points\tBready, oxidized aromas are imprecise and lacking in fruit. This is a blend of Palomino, Rufete Blanca and Moscatel from Salamanca, which is off the beaten path. A plump but flat palate of yeasty white-fruit flavors lacks zest on a fading finish. Drink now.\n25595\tSpain\tTeso de la Media Fanega\t85\t22\tCentral Spain\tSierra de Salamanca\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Zorra 2014 Teso de la Media Fanega Rufete (Sierra de Salamanca)\tRufete\tLa Zorra\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy aromas of roasted red plum blend with scents of latex and cured meat on a jumbled nose. Like any Rufete, this feels drawing and rubbery, with choppy tannins. Flavors of tomato, currant and red plum are tart and narrow on a drawing finish.\n99360\tSpain\tGarnacha\t87\t8\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVega Sindoa 2010 Garnacha Rosé (Navarra)\tRosé\tVega Sindoa\tLT_90_Points\tShiny pink in color, with a crisp and wet nose that powerfully suggests refreshment to come. Juicy and superfresh on the palate, with cherry and raspberry flavors and citrusy undertones. A real winner in Garnacha rosé from Navarra.\n119768\tSpain\tParticular Old Vine\t87\t14\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas San Valero 2012 Particular Old Vine Garnacha (Cariñena)\tGarnacha\tBodegas San Valero\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of exotic spices, licorice gumdrop, leather and raspberry announce a full-bodied palate. Saucy plum, oak and mustard-like flavors finish with a dash of cumin and a solid, grabby texture.\n125202\tSpain\t\t85\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo de Monséran 2014 Garnacha (Cariñena)\tGarnacha\tCastillo de Monséran\tLT_90_Points\tRubbery black plum and berry aromas lead to a fresh, tight palate with astringent tannins. Generic berry flavors are angular, while this everyday Garnacha is tannic and scratchy on the finish.\n51234\tSpain\tEl Cerezo Unoaked\t83\t12\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo de Monjardin 2012 El Cerezo Unoaked Chardonnay (Navarra)\tChardonnay\tCastillo de Monjardin\tLT_90_Points\tTropical aromas are friendly but basic. A melony feeling palate is low on acidity, thus flavors of honeydew and mango seem mushy. A soft, mealy finish with a papaya-like flavor is the last act. Year after year this unoaked Chardonnay barely gets by.\n10155\tSpain\tGlorioso Gran Reserva\t87\t36\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Palacio 2007 Glorioso Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Palacio\tLT_90_Points\tStalky, soupy berry aromas come up shy on elegance. This feels clampy and hard with rocky tannins. Standard berry fruit flavors are overshadowed by gritty stalky blackened accents, while the finish is grating and uncushioned but long.\n125032\tSpain\tCrianza\t85\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViña Ijalba 2005 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tViña Ijalba\tLT_90_Points\tUnusually exotic and strange on the bouquet, with blueberry, lemon peel and warm mulch aromas. The palate has size and pretty good feel, with tangy blue-fruit flavors, exotic spice notes and zip. Finishes with floral notes and lightness.\n88851\tSpain\t\t83\t13\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSeñorío de Sarria 2007 Chardonnay (Navarra)\tChardonnay\tSeñorío de Sarria\tLT_90_Points\tFairly flat on the nose, and also innocuous on the palate. Flavors of green melon and nectarine are modest at best, and while the mouthfeel is decent, the overall character of the wine isn't that exciting. Finishes pithy, citric and mealy. Yet another mediocre Navarran Chardonnay.\n99045\tSpain\tZios\t87\t20\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLusco 2013 Zios Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tLusco\tLT_90_Points\tPeach, melon and acacia aromas are friendly but simple. This has shearing acidity and thus it comes across fresh but lemony on the palate. Flavors of nectarine, lemon-lime and pineapple finish snappy and with lasting acidity.\n119210\tSpain\tRueda\t84\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEmina 2014 Rueda Verdejo-Viura (Rueda)\tVerdejo-Viura\tEmina\tLT_90_Points\tDusty, jumbled aromas of fleshy melon and stone fruits are not terribly defined. This has a soft mouthfeel and flavors of papaya, peach and bitter citrus pith. Drink immediately; contains 10% Viura.\n123640\tSpain\tCordon Negro Brut 150 años\t87\t12\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFreixenet NV Cordon Negro Brut 150 años Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tFreixenet\tLT_90_Points\tFreixenet's signature Cava is consistent and pure as usual, with aromas of white fruit and white pepper and an overall freshness on the nose. It feels crisp and focused, with a foamy palate that brings apple, lime, peach and spice flavors. The finish is smooth.\n18117\tSpain\tAdaro de Prado Rey\t89\t\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPradorey 2010 Adaro de Prado Rey  (Ribera del Duero)\tRed Blend\tPradorey\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy berry and gritty toast and leather aromas form a strong, masculine bouquet. This feels flush but also jagged due to hard tannins. Flavors of blackberry, fine coffee, mint and oak lead to a spicy, peppery tasting finish with oaky notes and power. Drink through 2016.\n48300\tSpain\tFlor de Lasierpe Viñas Viejas\t85\t22\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio Lasierpe 2007 Flor de Lasierpe Viñas Viejas Garnacha (Navarra)\tGarnacha\tDominio Lasierpe\tLT_90_Points\tFor a higher-priced wine, this has some issues. The nose is heavy and murky, with leathery, baked aromas. In the mouth, it's somewhat choppy and acidic, thus punctuating the cherry tomato portion of the earth-and-leather flavor profile. Lingering oak accents the finish, which is zesty and leans toward sour.\n18779\tSpain\tLas Gravas\t88\t32\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa Castillo 2012 Las Gravas Red (Jumilla)\tRed Blend\tCasa Castillo\tLT_90_Points\tRipe and soft on the nose, this blend of Monastrell, Garnacha and Syrah is so easygoing that it lacks pop up front. Plump and fruity on the palate, this is low on structure and acidity. Jammy raspberry and strawberry flavors end in friendly fashion, but with low definition. Drink now.\n2894\tSpain\tEl Pájaro Rojo\t86\t18\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLosada 2013 El Pájaro Rojo Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tLosada\tLT_90_Points\tReduced, floral and plummy on the nose, this is a simple, blocky, tannic young wine. Medicinal berry flavors finish loud and grapy, with a grabby, tacky feel. Fruit outweighs finesse.\n96329\tSpain\tPagos Viejos\t92\t100\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArtadi 2010 Pagos Viejos  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tArtadi\tGT_90_Points\tIntense but classy aromas of berry fruits, minerality, vanilla and chocolate are milder and richer than the wine's racy, structured, acid-rich palate. Flavors of blackberry come with a shock of bracing tartness, while oaky aftershocks offer up chocolate and woodspice flavors. A zesty, firm, hard-driving finish brings a touch of sharpness. Drink through 2022.\n117529\tSpain\tReserva\t90\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDinastía Vivanco 2005 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tDinastía Vivanco\tGT_90_Points\tRooty, leathery and spicy aromas accent dry baked-berry notes. The feel is smooth and natural, with texture and acidity supporting toasty, leathery, spicy berry and plum flavors. Mildly baked tasting on the finish, with cinnamon and pepper accents. Drink now through 2014.\n78041\tSpain\tCla Ror Gran Reserva Brut Nature\t90\t28\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVins El Cep 2010 Cla Ror Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tVins El Cep\tGT_90_Points\tYeasty, bready aromas of toast and apple set up a smooth, mature palate with good acidity. Apple, quince and dry yeasty, toasty flavors end with length, complexity and a mild note of baked apple. Drink now.\n48619\tSpain\tXA\t84\t14\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlbet I Noya 2014 XA Xarel-lo (Penedès)\tXarel-lo\tAlbet I Noya\tLT_90_Points\tBland aromas suggest applesauce. This varietal Xarello feels plump but flat. Candied, generic white-fruit flavors are nonspecific, while this offers up citrus notes and pyrazines on the finish.\n108129\tSpain\tAñ Vino Espumoso de Calidad Brut Nature\t86\t35\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Antaño NV Añ Vino Espumoso de Calidad Brut Nature Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tBodegas Antaño\tLT_90_Points\tThis smells yeasty and peachy, with a maderized quality to the bouquet. It tastes cidery and citrusy, with a light body and not much in the way of bubbles or vitality. The flavors of apple, lemon and peach are fair and fleshy. Tastes pithy on the finish.\n24529\tSpain\tEl Templari\t91\t28\tCatalonia\tTerra Alta\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCeller Bàrbara Forés 2013 El Templari Red (Terra Alta)\tRed Blend\tCeller Bàrbara Forés\tGT_90_Points\tImmediately you'll note that this is light and airy, with floral aromas and touches of cinnamon dust and leather. The blend is 70% Morenillo, an obscure Catalan variety, and Garnacha. The palate is fresh and lithe, while bright raspberry, herb and spice flavors finish in whole, integrated fashion. Drink through 2018.\n62681\tSpain\tCrianza\t85\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTaron 2008 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tTaron\tLT_90_Points\tDusty berry aromas blend with mint and herbal notes. This Tempranillo feels grabby and pinched; flavors of baked black fruits, vanilla and dill are earthy on the finish, which is chunky but generally balanced.\n81990\tSpain\tAbadal Selecció\t91\t49\tCatalonia\tPla de Bages\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMasies d'Avinyo 2002 Abadal Selecció Red (Pla de Bages)\tRed Blend\tMasies d'Avinyo\tGT_90_Points\tSerious wines from a tiny inland appellation in Catalonia—that's Abadal, a maker of true terroir wines that succeed way more often than they disappoint. This blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Syrah is minerally and full of red fruit and vanilla aromas. The palate is husky but correct, with full tannins, a kick of acidity and pure, ripe berry flavors. Even from a tough vintage it justifies its selected status.\n25677\tSpain\tClot de Roure\t84\t30\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqués de Gelida 2010 Clot de Roure Xarel-lo (Penedès)\tXarel-lo\tMarqués de Gelida\tLT_90_Points\tThis small-production (200 cases), barrel-aged Xarel-lo is well made but fails to strike a chord. It's yellow in color, with oily aromas of petrol, orange peel and wood resin. It feels sticky despite its supporting acids, and it tastes primarily of wood and white pepper, with a lasting bitterness.\n4264\tSpain\t\t85\t11\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCaracol Serrano 2013 Red (Jumilla)\tRed Blend\tCaracol Serrano\tLT_90_Points\tLeather and citrus aromas unleash a mild chemical note on the nose of this Monastrell-Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon blend. A solid palate with hard, poking tannins leads to cherry flavors that veer towards bitterness. This finishes woody, dry and slightly bitter.\n71718\tSpain\tAspiru\t93\t50\tCatalonia\tPenedès\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPardas 2007 Aspiru Red (Penedès)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tPardas\tGT_90_Points\tDry, earthy and leathery on the nose, with finely etched aromas of raspberries, plums and other red berries. This feels fresh and pure, with balance, weight, tannic grip and perfect acidity. It's bright, forward and juicy, with elevated flavors of plums, berries and peppery spices. A blend of 85% Cab Franc and 15% Cab Sauvignon.\n81629\tSpain\tEmeritus\t92\t100\tCentral Spain\tDominio de Valdepusa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Griñon 2007 Emeritus Red (Dominio de Valdepusa)\tRed Blend\tMarques de Griñon\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a ripe, rich blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Syrah that opens with blackberry, blueberry and earthy leather aromas. It's full bodied, lifted by nice acids and layered, with toast, meaty blackberry, licorice and roasted flavors. A chewy, smooth, deep finish functions as the final chapter. Drink through 2018.\n46661\tSpain\t\t85\t12\tSpain Other\tSpain\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLoca 2013 Verdejo (Spain)\tVerdejo\tLoca\tLT_90_Points\tFull, chunky aromas of banana, vanilla and yeasty lees set up a plump, somewhat flabby palate. Flavors of citrus pith, papaya and melon end pithy and slightly bitter, with modest acidity. Drink immediately.\n40244\tSpain\t\t91\t46\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFerrer Bobet 2013 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tFerrer Bobet\tGT_90_Points\tA bright purple tint announces a jumpy youthful-smelling wine with plum, black currant and oak aromas. This is Carignan, Syrah, Garnacha and Cab Sauvignon, and it's full in body but also juicy and lively. Savory, saucy plum and berry flavors ride a wave of crisp acidity, while the finish feels dry and exact, with minty medicinal overtones. Drink this snappy wine through 2021.\n70116\tSpain\tReserva\t89\t23\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDios Ares 2011 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tDios Ares\tLT_90_Points\tVery familiar Rioja aromas of cherry, plum and prune scream Tempranillo. This is wiry in feel, with tight, hammering acidity. Berry and black-cherry flavors finish on a subtle note of chocolate along with a final shot of juicy, sharp acidity.\n121816\tSpain\tReserva\t92\t65\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConsejo de la Alta 2011 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tConsejo de la Alta\tGT_90_Points\tRooty aromas of licorice and sarsparilla are oaky and toasty, like burnt bread crust. This reserva feels weighty, but well balanced. Spicy currant and plum flavors are racy and improve on an elegant finish that doesn't overreach. Drink through 2026.\n108925\tSpain\tRaso de Larrainzar\t84\t24\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPago de Larrainzar 2008 Raso de Larrainzar Red (Navarra)\tRed Blend\tPago de Larrainzar\tLT_90_Points\tThis blend of Tempranillo, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Garnacha is gamy on the nose, with aromas of tomato leaf, compost and cherry-pie filling. The palate is decidedly acidic, while flavors of zesty red fruits like red currant and sour plum come across herbal and a touch weedy.\n120756\tSpain\tViernes\t86\t13\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGodelia 2015 Viernes Mencía (Bierzo)\tMencía\tGodelia\tLT_90_Points\tJumpy berry aromas are simple and grapy. A plump but jagged and tannic palate tastes foxy and a touch herbal, while foresty, minty-green-berry flavors carry a scratchy finish.\n94468\tSpain\t\t87\t13\tNorthern Spain\tSomontano\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEnate 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Somontano)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Merlot\tEnate\tLT_90_Points\tGritty tomatoey aromas suggest rustic but underripe fruit. On the palate, this delivers a mix of freshness combined with a medium-full body. A mix of herbal berries and wood-based spice notes finish grabby and warm.\n16971\tSpain\tAntaño Reserva\t84\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJ. Garcia Carrion 2008 Antaño Reserva  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tJ. Garcia Carrion\tLT_90_Points\tThe wine is earthy, leathery and leafy on the nose. In the mouth, hard tannins lead to a stalky tasting, lightly baked set of mature black-fruit flavors. Carob and raisin flavors along with rubbery tannins define the finish\n50040\tSpain\tThe Invisible Man\t87\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa Rojo 2011 The Invisible Man  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tCasa Rojo\tLT_90_Points\tRaspberry and red-plum aromas are floral and fresh, but simple. This has a hard, almost metallic mouthfeel and red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry. A wiry, short finish is raw and snappy in feel, with a hint of oak.\n112282\tSpain\tTinto\t85\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBurgo Viejo 2012 Tinto  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBurgo Viejo\tLT_90_Points\tRaspberry aromas are simple but friendly. This feels condensed and a bit jammy, without a lot of stand-up structure. Candied, lightly loamy flavors of plum and currant finish modest and short.\n80969\tSpain\tBrut Selección\t86\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVilla Conchi NV Brut Selección Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tVilla Conchi\tLT_90_Points\tA briny, citrusy nose offers savory notes and a touch of funk. This feels energetic and racy on the palate, while briny citrus flavors are slightly stony. A light, quick, citrusy finish closes this out.\n83528\tSpain\tBrut Rosé\t85\t\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEximius NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tEximius\tLT_90_Points\tThis smells like rosé Cava should: orange and a puff of smoke make up the nose. Pulpy and citrusy on the palate, this delivers midlevel grapefruit and orange flavors before falling off some on the finish.\n39345\tSpain\t\t87\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBeronia 2016 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tBeronia\tLT_90_Points\tThis standard Verdejo is light on acidity, which is reflective of a hot year. Its citrus and green herb notes are fresh and prickly while its melon and thyme flavors lose intensity on the slightly bitter finish.\n92226\tSpain\tNegre\t87\t22\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJaspi 2011 Negre Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tJaspi\tLT_90_Points\tCoffee grinds, raisin and baked aromas suggest overripeness. This is heavy, broad and a bit clumsy on the palate. Berry and prune flavors are solid but not overly fresh, while the finish is full and raisiny as it improves over time.\n97690\tSpain\t\t87\t15\tGalicia\tRías Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLagar de Bouza 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas)\tAlbariño\tLagar de Bouza\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of nettle, citrus fruits and stream water set up a minerally palate with some plumpness.

This is a tight, drawing Tempranillo with tannic bite but also fruit in reserve. Flavors of raspberry and plum are more generic than elevated, while a toasty, slightly bitter finish with mild heat brings it home.\n30898\tSpain\t\t82\t\tNorthern Spain\tCariñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbrazo 2011 Garnacha (Cariñena)\tGarnacha\tAbrazo\tLT_90_Points\tScratchy, candied aromas of red fruits get things off to a rough start. The wine is acidic in feel, with tart, herbal red-fruit flavors. And it finishes pickled, with an herbal sharpness.\n490\tSpain\tReserva Brut\t87\t19\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tV&N; Cellars NV Reserva Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tV&N; Cellars\tLT_90_Points\tLime, apple and mineral aromas come with a note of eggy yeast. The mouthfeel is regular and a touch foamy, with semisweet flavors of kiwi, apple and gooseberry. Mild and feeling good on the finish, it's basic but well worth a go.\n101431\tSpain\t\t83\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRoquesán 2013 Rosado (Ribera del Duero)\tRosado\tRoquesán\tLT_90_Points\tDusty, candied aromas of raspberry and stone fruits aren't all that fresh or defined. This has a grabby, citric feel and briny red-fruit flavors that are echoed on a full, chunky finish.\n72196\tSpain\tAlbacea\t86\t11\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJuan Gil 2014 Albacea Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tJuan Gil\tLT_90_Points\tLightly herbal, mildly spicy aromas are fresh yet scratchy. This Monastrell is full and balanced, with a sensation of resiny oak to the palate feel. Pointed plum and raspberry flavors are oaky, spicy and drying on the finish.\n90327\tSpain\tParcela 52\t88\t20\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Constancia 2013 Parcela 52 Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tVerdejo\tFinca Constancia\tLT_90_Points\tDespite opening with a yellow color and waxy oily peach aromas, this benefits from zesty lemon-like acidity. Flavors of quince and apple are oaky, while effusive acidity keeps this Verdejo fresh on the finish, which is otherwise big and full. Drink now.\n11686\tSpain\tTarima\t87\t9\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVolver 2013 Tarima Monastrell (Alicante)\tMonastrell\tVolver\tLT_90_Points\tRipe, oaky and showing aromas of coconut, vanilla, raisin and prune, this easily approachable Monastrell is full, dark and stretched wide, with proper acidity keeping things fenced in and focused.

It feels zesty, solid and slightly clampy, with plum and cherry flavors that lead to a tight, juicy finish, with modest length and power\n51245\tSpain\t\t83\t10\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y León\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVolteo 2012 Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)\tVerdejo-Sauvignon Blanc\tVolteo\tLT_90_Points\tCitrus and passion fruit aromas emphasize the SB over the Verdejo component, even though the blend is 70% Verdejo and 30% SB. A zesty, pithy feeling palate houses citrus peel and pithy flavors, while the finish tastes the same.\n82704\tSpain\t\t88\t16\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVolver 2008 Tempranillo (La Mancha)\tTempranillo\tVolver\tLT_90_Points\tDark as night and thick, with heavy, modern aromas of shoe polish, bacon and ripe, roasted black fruits. The feel is concentrated and healthy, while the flavors run very ripe and dark, with plenty of oak thrown in. Finishes rich, with bacon, resin, black pepper and some burn. Seems more jacked up than its listed 14.5% alcohol.\n74328\tSpain\t\t83\t9\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNo BS 2009  Toro\tTempranillo-Garnacha\tNo BS\tLT_90_Points\tFor $9, one can be satisfied with the value, but this wine does smell a bit sour and herbal, while the feel is angular and acidic.

A majority of the oak was Hungarian, and a strong vanilla streak runs through the middle and on into the finish.

The 100% Cabernet, which is a limited production barrel selection of only 420 cases, is so delicious in blackberry jam, chocolate, olive and cedar flavors, it's hard to not drain the bottle now. But it also shows fabulously rich tannins that suggest aging.

It's fiery and almost citric on the nose, while the palate is ripe as can be, with spicecake and blackberry syrup flavors. It's not missing any potency or ripeness, but the longer you work with it the larger and more medicinal it gets. Think big Zinfandel from California when you take this on.\tMonastrell / Petit Verdot\tLT_90_Points\t36\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\tRed Blend\tPico Madama 2003 Monastrell / Petit Verdot Red (Jumilla)\n732\tFrance\tThis is a soft and jammy wine with attractive ripe strawberry fruit and only the lightest structure.

The palate is dark and concentrated but not exactly high voltage in terms of power. Flavors of raisin, cassis, fig and chocolate are rich and ripe, while the finish runs dark.

This is a wonderful expression of taut minerality, pure citrus zest and then a wood-toast character that gives the wine both richness and sophistication.

Dark chocolate and berry aromas and flavors pick up hints of dried tobacco and other herbs, ending on a crisp note. Give it two or three years, then drink it over the next 10–12.\tThe Ironstone Pressings Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvèdre\tGT_90_Points\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\tRhône-style Red Blend\tD'Arenberg 2008 The Ironstone Pressings Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvèdre Red (McLaren Vale)\n5568\tItaly\tTuscan dishes celebrate fresh, seasonal ingredients such as fava beans, artichokes, asparagus, zucchini and extra virgin olive oil.

It's expensive, but worth the price. It dazzles for soft lusciousness, and the depth and complexity of blackberries, black currants, cassis and chocolate, as well as the perfect integration of new French oak.

Still, the wine goes snap, crackle and pop on both the bouquet and palate. It's a crisp one, with live-wire cherry, cola and spice flavors. Not at all flabby, and instead runs lean and fresh. Good now and maybe better in a few more years.\t\tLT_90_Points\t112\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\tRed Blend\tL'Arbossar 2004 Red (Priorat)\n116136\tSpain\tHeavy oak aromas of vanilla, marshmallow and milk chocolate dominate the nose, flavor profile and finish on this candied, sticky blend.\tColorea\tLT_90_Points\t12\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\tTempranillo-Syrah\tBodegas Cristo de la Vega 2016 Colorea Red (La Mancha)\n30724\tPortugal\tPlanting Alvarinho in the Lisboa region, many miles south of its native Minho, could be risky. But winemaker José Neiva Correia took a chance on the ocean-climate similarities and the result is a wine that's as fresh and crisp as possible.

Still, this light-bodied wine appears to lack depth, complexity and length, offering just some odd, resiny scents and waxy, citrusy flavors.\tReserve\tLT_90_Points\t17\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\tSémillon\tPepper Tree 2006 Reserve Semillon (Hunter Valley)\n22835\tItaly\tGrassy, herbal notes add an interesting edge and characterize this luminous sparkling wine.

The blackberry juice flavors are broad, approachable and pleasantly airy on the palate, but quickly given complexity with coyote-brush woodiness, iron shavings and a solid tannic grip.\tMargarita Vineyard\tLT_90_Points\t20\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tCabernet Sauvignon\tBroadside 2012 Margarita Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)\n53373\tFrance\tThere is lovely richness here, with fresh acidity and red berry fruit flavors.

From the start, this struggles to keep it real. Aromas of shoe polish, vanilla and scorched oak are dominant. Firm and tannic in the mouth, this Carignan tastes almost entirely of wood resin and mint.

This foamy sparkling red is heavy on the palate, without much delicacy. Black cherry and boysenberry flavors are candied but not cloying, while a foamy, blocky finish is fruity yet ponderous due to low acidity.\tMarina Espumante Gran Selección 10°\tLT_90_Points\t15\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\tMonastrell\tBocopa NV Marina Espumante Gran Selección 10° Monastrell (Alicante)\n57273\tSlovenia\tWhile savory and smoky on the nose with subdued aromas of apple and pineapple, this dry yet fruity Furmint from Slovenia offers a host of bright tropical flavors.

It's very much in the modern Napa style, soft, rich and sophisticated, with cherry, red currant, Asian spice and new oak flavors. It's an elegant wine, but a fairly tannic one, with a dusty astringency that suggests mid-term aging. An auspicious, if expensive, new beginning.\tProprietary Red Wine\tGT_90_Points\t130\tCalifornia\tOakville\tNapa\t\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tContinuum 2005 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Oakville)\n70146\tUS\tThis ranks among the producer's biggest, boldest and most luxurious wines, a celebration of all that the appellation can offer in a stellar vintage.

The palate is rich, minerally and meaty, with slightly syrupy black fruit flavors, molasses and chocolate. Chewy, tannic and pure on the finish, with hints of herbs and lemon peel.

The flavor profile is uncommon but appealing, surely a result of the blend, which is Cabernet Sauvignon along with Carmenère and Petit Verdot.

The grapes are from a portion of the Wurtele Vineyard, which consistently produces spectacular Cabernets. The wine is rich enough to drink now for sheer power, but should easily hold in the bottle for years, gradually picking up bottle complexity.

This vintage is very rich and compact, with blackberry, marzipan and cola aromas. The palate is firm and sturdy, but more like a bench than a plush chair.

It's compact, tannic, and a bit unyielding, but structured with enough density to age for a few years. Light red fruits are somewhat overwhelmed by grainy, toasty tannins; that should balance out with a little more bottle age.\tReserve\tLT_90_Points\t27\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tCabernet Sauvignon\tColumbia Crest 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))\n37105\tUS\tThis rustic wine from a site just outside of Healdsburg offers a dense taste of grenadine liqueur and cola.

As you might expect from winemaker Ben Glaetzer and the Mitolo family, this is a full-bodied Shiraz, albeit not quite as lush and riveting as the 2005 version. The tannins this year are soft, the acids a bit on the tart side, giving the fruit a crisp edge.

Soft but structured tannins and a spin of spice on the finish recommend it for heartier dishes, but it's good enough to savor on its own.

Heavily charred, smoky and earthy, it's got a fair amount of dark cassis fruit to carry all the barrel toast and finishes with some notes of bark and stem.\n121309\tLT_90_Points\t0.697575518174094\t0.302424481825906\t121309\tSpain\tThird Generation 70th Anniversary\tLT_90_Points\t24\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\tTempranillo\tBodegas Fariña 2009 Third Generation 70th Anniversary  (Toro)\tAromas of baked earth blend with sassy, almost prickly cherry and leather notes in front of what amounts to a dense, slightly gummy feeling palate.

Astringent and tight as a drum now, but it will evolve in the bottle and should last another two decades.
