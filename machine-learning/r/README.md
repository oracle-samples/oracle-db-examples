# Oracle Machine Learning sample Notebooks in R language
The sample notebooks on this folder are expected to be used with Oracle Machine Learning for R.

The notebooks available in JSON format are compatible with any open-source Apache Zeppelin notebook environment.

That includes an Apache Zeppelin running on a server that can connect to an Oracle Database for using the OML4R notebook examples.

The OML4R notebooks can be used with an on-premise Oracle Database and also a Database Cloud Service (with the exception of the Autonomous Database, which runs its own Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks environment for R and Python).
