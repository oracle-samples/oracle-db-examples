This empowers users to find relevant information based on meaning and context, eliminating the pain point of transferring data to separate vector databases, thus reducing complexity and operational overhead. Starting with OML4Py 2.0, the client converts pre-trained transformer models from Hugging Face to the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format for AI Vector Search. Hugging Face is an open-source Python library for deep learning, offering thousands of pre-trained models for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, audio, and more. ONNX is an open format for representing various machine learning models, including transformers, classification, regression, and other types. The OML4Py client streamlines the path to embedding generation in the database by downloading pre-trained models from the Hugging Face repository, augmenting them with pre- and post-processing steps, converting the augmented model to ONNX format, and loading it into an in-database model or exporting it to a file. Once loaded in ONNX format, you can seamlessly use the in-database ONNX Runtime to generate vector embeddings for AI Vector Search. Combined with the OML4Py client, AI Vector Search offers a comprehensive solution for leveraging vector embeddings in Oracle Database, enhancing text data analysis, search capabilities, and machine learning applications. In this blog, we outline the steps to install the OML4Py client, provide examples of converting pre-configured and customized models to ONNX format, and load the models into Oracle Database. This applies to Oracle Database on-premises or on the cloud and Autonomous Database.\",","        \"Oracle Machine Learning for R (OML4R) and Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) each provide a script repository to store user defined R or Python functions in an Oracle Database or Autonomous Database instance. OML4R provides functions ore.scriptCreate and ore.scriptLoad, and OML4Py provides functions  oml.script.create and oml.script.load. These functions save R and Python UDFs into the script repository and reload the function back into the current local session. Functions are stored in the script repository specified as global or private, and given user-defined access privileges. If the global parameter is set to FALSE (the default) specifies that the script is not public and is visible only to the owner or to users to whom the owner has granted read privilege access; TRUE specifies that the script is public and therefore visible to all users. Functions in the script repository can be listed based on name, pattern, and type. (List options include user created scripts, global scripts, scripts granted to the user, scripts the user has granted access to, and all scripts). Scripts in the repository can also be dropped based on access level.\",","        \"We are pleased to announce the ability to use custom third-party packages on Oracle Autonomous Database. As we continue to expand Autonomous Database as a platform for data science and machine learning, users of Oracle Machine Learning (OML) Notebooks and OML4Py and OML4R embedded execution can now use custom-installed third-party packages through conda environments. With this feature, users can leverage the broader Python and R package ecosystems to augment database functionality on Oracle Autonomous Database in OML Notebooks. Run Python and R user-defined functions with third-party package functionality in engines spawned and managed by the database environment, while optionally taking advantage of OML4Py and OML4R system-provided data parallelism and task parallelism. This enables, for example, using native Python and R machine learning algorithms to build models, store them in the database, and make predictions from SQL and REST APIs. Creating and using conda environments. OML Notebooks introduces a conda interpreter that enables a user with administrator privileges to install third-party Python and R packages in a conda environment for use within OML Notebooks sessions, as well as OML4R and OML4Py embedded execution invocations. Python, R, and REST interfaces for embedded execution are currently available, with the SQL embedded execution API coming soon. Conda is an open source package and environment management system that enables the use of virtual environments containing third-party Python and R packages. With conda environments, you can install and update packages and their dependencies, as well as switch between environments to use project-specific packages. Users with administrator privileges create conda environments, install packages, and upload conda environments to Object Storage.

Starting with OML4Py 2.0, the client converts pre-trained transformer models from Hugging Face to the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format for AI Vector Search. Hugging Face is an open-source Python library for deep learning, offering thousands of pre-trained models for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, audio, and more. ONNX is an open format for representing various machine learning models, including transformers, classification, regression, and other types. The OML4Py client streamlines the path to embedding generation in the database by downloading pre-trained models from the Hugging Face repository, augmenting them with pre- and post-processing steps, converting the augmented model to ONNX format, and loading it into an in-database model or exporting it to a file. Once loaded in ONNX format, you can seamlessly use the in-database ONNX Runtime to generate vector embeddings for AI Vector Search. Combined with the OML4Py client, AI Vector Search offers a comprehensive solution for leveraging vector embeddings in Oracle Database, enhancing text data analysis, search capabilities, and machine learning applications. In this blog, we outline the steps to install the OML4Py client, provide examples of converting pre-configured and customized models to ONNX format, and load the models into Oracle Database. This applies to Oracle Database on-premises or on the cloud and Autonomous Database.\nStoring Named R and Python Functions in the Oracle Machine Learning (OML) Script Repository\tOracle Machine Learning for R (OML4R) and Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) each provide a script repository to store user defined R or Python functions in an Oracle Database or Autonomous Database instance. OML4R provides functions ore.scriptCreate and ore.scriptLoad, and OML4Py provides functions  oml.script.create and oml.script.load. These functions save R and Python UDFs into the script repository and reload the function back into the current local session. Functions are stored in the script repository specified as global or private, and given user-defined access privileges. If the global parameter is set to FALSE (the default) specifies that the script is not public and is visible only to the owner or to users to whom the owner has granted read privilege access; TRUE specifies that the script is public and therefore visible to all users. Functions in the script repository can be listed based on name, pattern, and type. (List options include user created scripts, global scripts, scripts granted to the user, scripts the user has granted access to, and all scripts). Scripts in the repository can also be dropped based on access level.\nAnnouncing custom third-party Python and R packages for use on Autonomous Database\tWe are pleased to announce the ability to use custom third-party packages on Oracle Autonomous Database. As we continue to expand Autonomous Database as a platform for data science and machine learning, users of Oracle Machine Learning (OML) Notebooks and OML4Py and OML4R embedded execution can now use custom-installed third-party packages through conda environments. With this feature, users can leverage the broader Python and R package ecosystems to augment database functionality on Oracle Autonomous Database in OML Notebooks. Run Python and R user-defined functions with third-party package functionality in engines spawned and managed by the database environment, while optionally taking advantage of OML4Py and OML4R system-provided data parallelism and task parallelism. This enables, for example, using native Python and R machine learning algorithms to build models, store them in the database, and make predictions from SQL and REST APIs. Creating and using conda environments. OML Notebooks introduces a conda interpreter that enables a user with administrator privileges to install third-party Python and R packages in a conda environment for use within OML Notebooks sessions, as well as OML4R and OML4Py embedded execution invocations. Python, R, and REST interfaces for embedded execution are currently available, with the SQL embedded execution API coming soon. Conda is an open source package and environment management system that enables the use of virtual environments containing third-party Python and R packages. With conda environments, you can install and update packages and their dependencies, as well as switch between environments to use project-specific packages. Users with administrator privileges create conda environments, install packages, and upload conda environments to Object Storage. These environments can then be accessed by non-administrator users and loaded into their own notebooks for use.\n","type":"TABLE"}],"taskStatus":"SUCCESS","forms":"[]","status":"SUCCESS"},"sizeX":0,"hideCode":false,"width":12,"hideResult":true,"dynamicFormParams":"{}","row":0,"hasTitle":true,"hideVizConfig":true,"hideGutter":true,"relations":[],"forms":"[]"},{"col":0,"visualizationConfig":null,"hideInIFrame":false,"selectedVisualization":"raw","title":"Create a database table containing blog content","message":["%python","","try:","    oml.drop(table='OML_BLOG_CONTENT') ","except:","    pass","","oml.create(document_df, table=\"OML_BLOG_CONTENT\")"],"enabled":true,"result":{"startTime":1736976469809,"interpreter":"python.gpu","endTime":1736976470711,"results":[{"message":"                                                TITLE                                            CONTENT\n0   Getting started with Oracle Machine Learning f...
