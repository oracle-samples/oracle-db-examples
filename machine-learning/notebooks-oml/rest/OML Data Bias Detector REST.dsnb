Positive values indicate one group has more samples, zero suggests balance, and negative values show the opposite.","","2. **Statistical Parity (SP):** Assesses whether positive outcomes are distributed proportionally among groups. Zero indicates no bias, positive values suggest one group is favored, and negative values indicate  opposite.","","3. **Conditional Demographic Disparity (CDD):** Identifies hidden biases across subgroups. Positive values indicate one group is favored, near zero suggests no disparity, and negative values show the opposite.","","The data bias detector provides quantitative measures of data bias without predefining a threshold for what is considered bias.
