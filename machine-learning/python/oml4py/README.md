# Oracle Machine Learning for Python
Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) supports scalable in-database data exploration and preparation using native Python syntax, scalable in-database algorithms for machine learning model building and scoring, and automated machine learning (AutoML). Users can also invoke user-defined Python functions from Python, SQL and REST APIs using database-spawned Python engines. OML4Py increases data scientist productivity and reduces solution deployment complexity.

Python is a major programming language used for data science and machine learning. OML4Py is a feature on Oracle Autonomous Database that provides Python users access to powerful in-database functionality supporting data scientists for both scalability, performance, and ease of solution deployment. 

OML4Py is available on premises for Oracle Database 21c. 

For current examples for Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks with Autonomous Database, please look under the [machine-learning/notebooks/python](https://github.com/oracle/oracle-db-examples/tree/master/machine-learning/notebooks/python) folder in this repository

These Jupyter notebooks are compatible with the current OML4Py client
