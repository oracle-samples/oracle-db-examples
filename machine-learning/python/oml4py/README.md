# Oracle Machine Learning components for the Python language (coming soon)
Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) is a component of the Oracle Machine Learning family of products.

OML4Py is going to be initially available inside Oracle Autonomous Database, but we expect it to be released later on all Oracle Database platforms.

For current examples for Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks with Autonomous Database, please look under the [machine-learning/notebooks/python](https://github.com/oracle/oracle-db-examples/tree/master/machine-learning/notebooks/python) folder in this repository

Outside of the Autonomous Database, OML4Py will be compatible Oracle Linux 7.x (or RHEL 7.x) and Python 3.x.

Notebook OML4Py Demos are available under the machine-learning/notebooks/python

The examples here would run on either environment.
