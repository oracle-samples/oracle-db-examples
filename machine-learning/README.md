# Oracle Machine Learning Examples
The Oracle Machine Learning product family enables scalable data science projects. Data scientists, analysts, developers, and IT can achieve data science project goals faster while taking full advantage of the Oracle platform.

Oracle Machine Learning consists of complementary components supporting scalable machine learning algorithms for in-database and big data environments, notebook technology, SQL and R APIs, and Hadoop/Spark environments.

With Oracle Machine Learning, Oracle moves the algorithms to the data, processing data where it residesâ€”minimizing or eliminating data movement, achieving scalability, preserving security, and accelerating time-to-model deployment. Oracle delivers parallelized in-database implementations of machine learning algorithms and integration with open source R.

The following structure represent the available APIs and environments for the different examples of the Oracle Machine Learning components:

* datasets - example data in CSV format

* gui - Oracle Data Miner examples

* notebooks (Oracle Machine Learning Noteboks, Zeppelin, Jupyter, or Oracle Data Studio)
  * mixed - examples of use of mixed APIs in the same Notebook
  * python - Oracle Machine Learning for Python Notebooks
  * r - Oracle Machine Learning for R Notebooks, and Oracle Machine Learning for Spark Notebooks
  * sql - Notebooks for the Oracle Machine Learning for SQL and also the Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks (based on Zeppelin) included with Oracle ADW and ATP

* python - Oracle Machine Learning for Python examples

* r
  * oml4r - Oracle Machine Learning for R (in-Database) R code examples
  * oml4spark - Oracle Machine Learning for Spark (in-Data Lake) R code examples

* sql
  * 19c - Oracle Machine Learning for SQL examples for Oracle Database 19c
  * 20c - Oracle Machine Learning for SQL examples for Oracle Database 20c
