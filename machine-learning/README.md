# Oracle-Machine-Learning
Oracle Machine Learning Oracle Machine Learning is collaborative user interface for data scientists who perform machine learning in the Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud (ADWC)  Oracle Machine Learning enables data scientists, citizen data scientists, and data analysts to work together to explore their data and develop analytical methodologies in the Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud.  Oracle's high performance, parallel and scalable in-Database implementations of machine learning algorithms are exposed via SQL and PL/SQL using notebook technologies.  Oracle Machine Learning enables teams to collaborate to build, assess, and deploy machine learning models, while increasing data scientist productivity Oracle Machine Learning focuses on ease of use and simplified machine learning for data science – from preparation through deployment – all in the ADWC.

Based on Apache Zeppelin notebook technology, Oracle Machine Learning provides a common platform with a single interface that can connect to multiple data sources and access multiple back-end ADWC servers.  Multi-user collaboration enables the same notebook document to be opened simultaneously by different users, such that changes made by one user to a notebook are instantaneously reflected to all users viewing that notebook. To support enterprise requirements for security, authentication, and auditing, Oracle Machine Learning supports privilege-based access to data, models, and notebooks, as well as being integrated with Oracle security protocols.
