Some details about the pre-season trackday at Donington on Sunday 13th March:
<br><b>
<br>Ethos</b>
<br>
<br>This is a track day, not a test day.&nbsp; It is designed as a social occasion for our drivers and their families and supporters to meet up and have some fun whilst "blowing out the cobwebs". There will be novice drivers and passengers on track and aggressive driving will not be tolerated.
<br>
<br><b>Organisers</b>
<br>
<br>The day is being organised for CGRC by <a href="http://www.bookatrack.com/">Bookatrack</a>.&nbsp; Please refer to their terms and conditions. We will be running open pitlane except for two novice sessions.
<br>
<br>Please note that Bookatrack normally offer a "no queues" guarantee.&nbsp; Since the number of bookings was set by GCRC, not Bookatrack, that guarantee does not apply for this event.&nbsp; The amount of queing (if any) is likely to depend on the number of extra drivers going out. We do want to encourage friends and relatives go out, but please don't abuse the system. 
<br>
<br><b>*IMPORTANT* Extra Drivers</b>
<br>
<br>Bookatrack have just told us that extra drivers MUST be pre-registered.I therefore need an email from anyone who wants to allow someone else to drive their car.&nbsp; Please send an email to <a href="mailto:chairman@graduates.org.uk">chairman@graduates.org.uk</a> with the following information:
<br>
<br>Your Name
<br>Your Race Number
<br>Extra Driver Name(s)

<br>Garage Plan</b>
<br><br>Available in the "Comp Info" section of our web site. Direct link <a href="http://www.graduates.org.uk/docs/201639_CGRC%20Donington%20Park%20Pit%20Plan%2013-Mar-16%20(Version%205.0).docx">here</a>
<br>
<br><b>Sign On and Briefing</b>
<br><br>Will be in the Paddock Suite (large building to the left of the garages).
<br>
<br><i>DON'T FORGET</i> to bring your road driving licence. An MSA race licence is <i>not </i>an acceptable substitute. Foreign licences should be acceptable if you don't hold a UK licence.
<br>
<br>There is no scrutineering, but our series scrutineer Keith Marchment will be attending, and will be happy to look over your car or answer any questions about preparedness for racing.
<br>
<br><b>Late Briefings</b>
<br><br>All drivers must attend a briefing. Any drivers not able to attend the morning briefing will have to speak nicely to Bookatrack and ask for a personal briefing.
<br>
<br><b>Lunch</b>
<br><br>Bookatrack are organising a hog roast for us in their new "Caterham Midlands" facility on the edge of the main paddock. There should be enough to go round if each person brings the usual one guest. Please don't take the mickey - if you've got five friends turning up please ask them to use the Paddock Diner instead.
<br>
<br>Tea and coffee will be available all day in garage 17/18. 
<br>
<br><b>Paddock Access Saturday</b>
<br>
<br>To be determined, watch the forum for more information.&nbsp; Worst case you will be able to park outside the paddock entrance overnight, but we hope to do better than that.
<br>
<br><b>Instruction</b>
<br>
<br>If you're interested in instruction (at extra cost) from one of the Bookatrack ARDS-registered instructors, please email <a href="mailto:nick.portlock@bookatrack.com">nick.portlock@bookatrack.com</a>.
