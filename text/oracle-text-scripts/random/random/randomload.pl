# Generate random text for inserting into a table
# creates a SQL script for loading with SQL*Plus
#
#  Words are constructed of consonents and vowels alternating
#  only a few characters are used to make sure there are not too many permutations
#  (20 possible 2 letter words, 100 x 3 letter, 400 x 4 letter, 2000 x 5 letter, etc)
#  Add more or less letters to alter the permutations
#
#  Script is not that fast - takes half an hour or so to create 
#  1 million documents (about 1GB of text at max 500 words per doc)
#  - about 30,000 documents per minute
# 
#  This version creates the table as well
#  Note: 500 words of 8 chars may occasionally blow the SQL*Plus string size limit
#  We don't bother to trap that, may mean you get one or two rows per million
#  which fail to load.
