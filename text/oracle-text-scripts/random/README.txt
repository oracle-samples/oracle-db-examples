Various scripts for creating semi-random text
Real text is nowhere near random, words tend to be mostly 1 to 10 letters long,
and particular letters are over-represented. Many words are repeated.
If we generated truly random words, they would mostly be unique, there would be
no concept of common and uncommon words
So we use a limited set of vowels and consonents, which gives us a vaguely 
realistic spread of words in the output.
This is useful for high-volume testing in Oracle Text.
