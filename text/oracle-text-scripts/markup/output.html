The domestic <A HREF=#ctx2>&lt;</A> <A NAME=ctx3><B>dog</B></A> <A
HREF=#ctx4>&gt;</A> (Canis lupus familiaris)[2][3] is the 18-31,000 year old
descendant of a now extinct European Wolf,[4] and a member of the Canidae family
of the mammalian order Carnivora. The term "domestic <A HREF=#ctx3>&lt;</A> <A
NAME=ctx4><B>dog</B></A> <A HREF=#ctx5>&gt;</A>" is generally used for both
domesticated and feral varieties. The <A HREF=#ctx4>&lt;</A> <A
NAME=ctx5><B>dog</B></A> <A HREF=#ctx6>&gt;</A> was the first domesticated
animal[5][6] and has been the most widely kept working, hunting, and pet animal
in human history.[citation needed] The word "<A HREF=#ctx5>&lt;</A> <A
NAME=ctx6><B>dog</B></A> <A HREF=#ctx7>&gt;</A>" can also refer to the male of a
canine species,[7] as opposed to the word "bitch" which refers to the female of
the
species.

Recent studies of "well-preserved remains of a <A
HREF=#ctx6>&lt;</A> <A NAME=ctx7><B>dog</B></A> <A HREF=#ctx8>&gt;</A>-like
canid from the Razboinichya Cave" in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia
concluded that a particular instance of early wolf domestication approximately
33,000 years ago did not result in modern <A HREF=#ctx7>&lt;</A> <A
NAME=ctx8><B>dog</B></A> <A HREF=#ctx9>&gt;</A> lineages, possibly because of
climate disruption during the Last Glacial Maximum.[5][8] The authors postulate
that at least several such incipient events have occurred. A study of fossil <A
HREF=#ctx8>&lt;</A> <A NAME=ctx9><B>dogs</B></A> <A HREF=#ctx10>&gt;</A> and
wolves in Belgium, Ukraine, and Russia tentatively dates domestication from
14,000 years ago to more than 31,700 years ago.[9] Another recent study has
found support for claims of <A HREF=#ctx9>&lt;</A> <A NAME=ctx10><B>dog</B></A>
<A HREF=#ctx11>&gt;</A> domestication between 14,000 and 16,000 years ago, with
a range between 9,000 and 34,000 years ago, depending on mutation rate
assumptions.[10] <A HREF=#ctx10>&lt;</A> <A NAME=ctx11><B>Dogs</B></A> <A
HREF=#ctx12>&gt;</A>' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly
becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. <A HREF=#ctx11>&lt;</A> <A
NAME=ctx12><B>Dogs</B></A> <A HREF=#ctx13>&gt;</A> perform many roles for
people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police
and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals.
This impact on human society has given them the nickname "man's best friend" in
the Western world. In some cultures, however, <A HREF=#ctx12>&lt;</A> <A
NAME=ctx13><B>dogs</B></A> <A HREF=#ctx14>&gt;</A> are also a source of
meat.[11][12] In 2001, there were estimated to be 400 million <A
HREF=#ctx13>&lt;</A> <A NAME=ctx14><B>dogs</B></A> <A HREF=#ctx15>&gt;</A> in
the
world.[13]

Most breeds of <A HREF=#ctx14>&lt;</A> <A
NAME=ctx15><B>dog</B></A> <A HREF=#ctx16>&gt;</A> are at most a few hundred
years old, having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and
behaviors by people for specific functional roles. Through this selective
breeding, the <A HREF=#ctx15>&lt;</A> <A NAME=ctx16><B>dog</B></A> has developed
into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological
variation than any other land mammal.[14] For example, height measured to the
withers ranges from 15.2 centimetres (6.0 in) in the Chihuahua to about 76 cm
(30 in) in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually
called "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" or
"chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long,
coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.[15] It is common for
most breeds to shed this coat.
