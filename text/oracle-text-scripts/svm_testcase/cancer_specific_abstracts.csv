"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colon cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in the United States. Poor prognosis also makes it one of the deadliest cancers. Dietary factors are closely associated with tumorigenesis and development of colon cancer. Soy foods and soy bioactive components have been linked to lower colon cancer incidence in populations consuming large quantity of soy foods. However there are controversies and mechanisms by which soy products and soy bioactive components exert anticancer effects remain unknown. Because of lack of scientific evidence on the mechanisms of soy foods' cancer prevention potentials, there are no nutritional recommendations made to Americans. Based on current knowledge of colon cancer and preliminary data on beneficial actions of soy foods, the present proposal will test the hypothesis that dietary soy modulates colon cancer development through epigenetic programming at specific genes of WNT signaling pathway. An early maternal exposure model will be used for epigenetic programming by soy foods in colon of offspring rats. Using techniques including methylation analysis of CpG islands and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to a pathway-specific microarray, specific aims in this proposal include: 1) to identify specific genes along the WNT signaling pathway that are modified epigenetically by maternal soy diets; 2) to determine the extent to which the WNT pathway is affected in colon in rats by soy foods; and 3) to monitor protection from getting colon cancer in later life of offspring rats with life long exposure to soy foods. Findings from this project will improve our understandings on anticancer mechanisms of soy products at epigenetic level and facilitate future experimental design for further research on soy foods and colon cancer prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Findings from this project will improve our understandings on anticancer mechanisms of soy products at epigenetic level and aid future experimental design for further research on soy foods and colon cancer prevention. Data obtained will facilitate translational research in the future to define dietary recommendations for soy foods for American populations."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling network has emerged as a master regulator of essential processes in cell and developmental biology, including cell growth, proliferation, cellular differentiation, and metabolism. The multiple FDA-approved clinical applications of rapamycin attest to the central importance of mTOR in medicine. Recent evidence has also revealed a key role for mTOR signaling in modulating lifespan in addition to impacting health span. Molecular dissection of the mTOR regulatory network will facilitate development of therapeutics against aging and aging-related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer. mTOR assembles two biochemically and functionally distinct protein complexes - mTORC1 and mTORC2, which nucleate distinct pathways and yet crosstalk extensively. The current knowledge of mTOR complex assembly is largely derived from conventional biochemical characterizations, which typically require lengthy and strenuous purification procedures that may disrupt native complexes, and offer limited insights into the stoichiometry and heterogeneity of complex formation. We (the Ha laboratory) have recently developed a single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) method that enables rapid and sensitive analysis of protein complexes at single-complex resolution, directly from whole cell lysates. Here we propose to dissect the assembly of mTORC1 and mTORC2 employing the SiMPul approach. Stoichiometry of each component in the complexes will be determined. Regulation of the complexes by upstream signals, and potential physical crosstalk between the two complexes, will also be examined. Furthermore, we will develop a single-molecule kinase assay with the SiMPull platform, and apply this novel approach to interrogating the activities of various mTOR complexes. The proposed study is expected to decipher the assembly of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 at the single-complex level and reveal structure-function relationships in the mTOR assemblies. Knowledge to be gained from this study will be invaluable in guiding future investigation of the mTOR regulatory network and in facilitating potentially novel design of therapeutic strategies."
"? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding the molecular wiring that controls the highly coordinated process of skeletal myogenesis in adult muscle repair and regeneration will have significant impact on human health issues ranging from muscular dystrophies to disease- and aging-related muscle atrophy. Previous work from our laboratory established the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling as a master regulator of myogenesis by controlling distinct stages of myogenic differentiation. In the current grant cycle we have uncovered new players and pathways, and brought into focus a unique myogenic mTOR signaling network. These discoveries have taken us into new directions of investigation with the promise of deeper molecular understanding of myogenic regulation. With a combination of biochemical, molecular, cellular and genetic approaches, and utilizing both in vitro and in vivo experimental systems, we aim to (1) dissect the Vps34 pathway upstream of mTOR and examine its function in muscle regeneration, (2) uncover the mechanism by which mTOR exerts a kinase-independent function in the regulation of IGF-II expression through the transcriptional regulator YY1 in myogenesis, and (3) study the mechanism and function of XPLN in negative regulation of mTOR and myogenesis. Our expertise in biochemical characterization of signal transduction mechanisms as well as in muscle biology, our strong preliminary data, and the unique animal models available or under development, put us in an ideal position to pursue the proposed studies. New regulators and novel molecular interactions in regenerative myogenesis will likely be uncovered, which could be explored in the future for therapeutic targets in musculardystrophies and disease- and aging-related muscle atrophy."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skeletal muscle differentiation is a well-orchestrated process regulated by autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine factors via a regulatory network of signal transduction pathways. In recent years the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has begun to be recognized as a critical regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation, growth and hypertrophy. Work from our laboratory has contributed to the current understanding of mTOR regulation of myoblast differentiation, and has led to the revelation that mTOR regulates multiple stages of myogenesis by assembling distinct pathways, some of which unexpected and yet to be fully delineated. With a combination of biochemical, molecular, cellular and genetic approaches, and utilizing both in vitro and in vivo systems, we aim to fill a sizable gap in the current knowledge of molecular pathways underlying the regulation of skeletal myogenesis by addressing these three major questions: (1) How are the known components of growth-regulating mTOR pathway involved in myogenesis, and what is the mTOR pathway(s) that regulates the initiation of myoblast differentiation in response to amino acids availability signals? (2) What is the mTOR pathway that specifically regulates the second-stage myocyte fusion critical for myotube/myofiber growth and maturation, and which secreted factors regulate this process? (3) What is mTOR's role in muscle regeneration and what are the mechanisms? Our expertise in biochemical characterization of signal transduction mechanisms, our strong preliminary data, and the unique animal models we have created, put us in an ideal position to tackle those questions.

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skeletal muscle differentiation is a well-orchestrated process regulated by autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine factors via multiple signal transduction pathways. The bacterial macrolide rapamycin inhibits a wide spectrum of cellular functions, from proliferation, growth, to differentiation, and it has served as a powerful tool to probe relevant signaling pathways. While the rapamycin-sensitive pathway is under intensive investigation in the context of cell growth and proliferation, its importance in skeletal muscle development is only beginning to be recognized. The mammalian target of rapamycin - mTOR- is a multi-functional protein that serves as a central component of multiple signaling pathways that are inhibited by rapamycin. Preliminary studies from this investigator's laboratory have revealed an essential function of mTOR in skeletal muscle differentiation and the existence of novel mechanisms of mTOR signaling. The proposed studies are designed to test the hypothesis that an mTOR pathway distinct from that in cell growth and proliferation regulates skeletal muscle satellite cell differentiation by controlling the autocrine production of IGF-I and IGF-II. With a combination of biochemical, molecular, cellular and genetic approaches, and in the systems of a tissue culture model (C2C12) and mouse primary satellite cells, the specific aims of this proposal are to investigate (1) regulation of IGF autocrine production by mTOR; (2) involvement of a phospholipase D-phosphatidic acid-mTOR pathway in myogenesis; and (3) mTOR's structure-function relationship and novel signaling partners in differentiation. Knowledge gained in these studies will not only provide invaluable insights into the signaling mechanisms of the pleiotropic mTOR pathway, but also make significant contributions to the molecular understanding of skeletal muscle development, which is tightly coupled to health-related issues such as muscular dystrophy, exercise-induced hypertrophy, and aging-related atrophy."
"Cell proliferation is regulated by extracellular mitogens via two distinct types of signal transduction pathways: one transduces the signals from the membrane to the nucleus, resulting in transcriptional regulation; the other involves membrane-to-cytoplasm signalling that leads to translational regulation. Whereas the membrane-to-nucleus pathways have been extensively studied, as exemplified by the well-known ras/MAP kinase cascade, pathways leading to translational regulation are poorly characterized at the molecular level. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular mechanism of signal transduction leading to translational regulation. A working hypothesis for the current research is that the human protein FRAP (FKBP 12-rapamycin-associated protein), a member of the recently discovered family of phosphatidylinositol kinase (PIK)-related kinases, plays a major role in the rapamycin-sensitive signalling pathway that controls translational initiation. This proposal focuses on exploring the biochemical mechanism of FRAP's function and delineating the FRAP signalling pathway. In the system of mammalian tissue culture cells, a biochemical approach combined with molecular biology and genetic methodologies will be employed to address specific questions such as: What is the function of the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain in FRAP and what is the mechanism for rapamycin inhibition of this pathway? What is the physiological substrate for the FRAP kinase? How does FRAP propagate signals to downstream effectors? What are the other components of the pathway and how do they interact to create the circuitry of signal transduction in this pathway? Understanding the biochemistry and regulation of the FRAP protein will not only be essential for unraveling its cellular function, but may also provide insight into the mechanisms of action for other members of the PIK-related kinase family. Delineating the FRAP pathway should ultimately lead to answers to the fundamental question of how the cell cycle machinery is coupled to the translational machinery to achieve regulation of cell proliferation at the translational level."
"The effects of mitogens on cell proliferation are mediated by increases in both transcription and translation. Much is known about the signaling pathways that link extracellular signals to the nucleus, but less is known about the precise mechanisms involved in the regulation of protein synthesis. Recent studies by a number of investigators have shown that protein translation is regulated by a signaling pathway that is inhibited by the immunosuppressant, rapamycin. Rapamycin in a complex with its binding protein, FKBP-12, binds to a protein termed FRAP (FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein). By an unknown mechanism the binding of FKBP12-rapamycin to FRAP interferes with signaling initiated by receptor activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). The most well characterized effects of rapamycin are inhibition of p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), a regulator of translational initiation, and decreased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, a regulator of initiation factor eIF-4E. FRAP is related in primary amino acid sequence to the family of lipid kinases that includes PI3K, however, it is thought to be a protein kinase. Potential substrates for FRAP are 4E-BP1 and regulators of protein phosphatase activity. This application is aimed at investigating several aspects of FRAP. In Aim I, the function of FRAP will be investigated through the identification of novel substrates. The relationship of these substrates to the regulation of p70S6K and 4E- BP1 will be studied. In Aim II, the role of the domain of FRAP that binds FKBP12-rapamycin will be studied. In Aim III, novel proteins that associate with FRAP in a multi-protein complex will be purified and characterized. In Aim IV, the relationship of FRAP to the regulation of protein phosphatases will be studied. By understanding the detailed biochemical properties of FRAP, fundamental questions of how protein translation is coupled to cell cycle progression will be answered."
"? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling network is a master regulator of essential cellular and developmental processes, including cell growth, proliferation, cellular differentiation, and metabolism. Dysregulation of mTOR signaling has been found in a wide range of human diseases such as cancer, metabolic diseases, and neurological disorders. The overall goal of the proposed studies is to understand mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling mechanisms in cell growth regulation, with a focus on the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA). Our previous work established PA and its biosynthetic enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) as critical mediators of mitogenic and amino acid activation of mTORC1. In the current grant cycle we have gained new insights into the mechanisms and upstream pathways in PA regulation of mTORC1. These recent discoveries have taken us into new directions of investigation with the promise of deeper molecular understanding of this complex signaling network. Combining well-established biochemical approaches with biophysical methods that we have recently developed, we will dissect the biochemical mechanisms of PA- mTORC1 signaling in the experimental system of mammalian cell culture. Our specific aims are to (1) investigate leucyl tRNA synthetase (LRS) as an amino acid sensor for the Vps34-PLD-mTORC1 pathway, (2) dissect the interaction between PA and mTOR using single-molecule assays, and (3) study novel mTOR- interacting proteins under the regulation of PA. Our biochemical and biophysical expertise and strong preliminary data put us in an ideal position to pursue the proposed studies. Accomplishing these aims will likely lead to novel mechanistic insights into mTORC1 signaling and regulation of cell growth. The new regulators and molecular interactions uncovered could be potentially explored in the future as therapeutic targets in diseases involving mTOR, such as cancer."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phospholipase D (PLD) and its enzymatic product, the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA), are critically involved in the regulation of a wide range of mammalian cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, cell migration, and cell growth/proliferation. Work from our laboratory in recent years has uncovered a connection between PLD/PA and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling network - a master regulator of cell growth by integrating growth factor and nutrient signals, and an attractive target for drug development against several human diseases including cancer. This pathway from PLD to mTOR has provided a mechanism for the involvement of PLD in cell growth regulation and cancer, and at the same time has implicated the existence of a regulatory network involving PLD1 that is yet to be delineated. In the proposed studies we aim to dissect the molecular wiring of PLD1 signaling, with an emphasis on the role of PLD/PA in the regulation of the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex (mTORC1) in response to mitogenic and amino acid signals. Guided by working hypotheses based on our most recent findings, we propose to investigate the mechanisms underlying (1) mitogenic regulation of PLD, (2) amino acid regulation of PLD, and (3) PA regulation of mTORC1. Our experience with both PLD and mTOR signaling studies, our compelling preliminary data, and the unique tools available to us situate us in an ideal position to tackle those important issues.

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. Epidemiological evidence indicates a decreased risk of prostate cancer with increased consumption of tomato products. Tomatoes contain a variety of carotenoids, some of which have been shown to have antioxidant and anticancer effects. Recent research has focused on the primary tomato carotenoid, lycopene, yet few studies have been conducted with the carotenoid biosynthetic precursors of lycopene, phytoene and phytofluene. We hypothesize that in addition to lycopene, phytoene and phytofluene contribute to the reduced risk of prostate cancer. It is unclear how well phytoene and phytofluene are absorbed, metabolized, and made available for use in the prostate, because phytoene and phytofluene are not commercially available. Reliable methods to produce, isolate, and analyze these carotenoids must be developed. The overall objective of this work is to optimize a tomato cell suspension culture system to biosynthesize 14C-radiolabeled phytoene and phytofluene for bioavailability, metabolism, and biodistribution studies of these carotenoids in an animal model. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To utilize an in vitro tomato cell suspension culture system to produce both 14C-radiolabeled phytoene and phytofluene through the addition of a phytoene desaturase inhibitor, norflurazon, 2) To optimize the extraction and separation of 14C-radiolabeled phytoene and phytofluene from tomato cell suspension cultures, 3) To determine the bioavailability, metabolism, and biodistribution of 14C-radiolabeled phytoene and phytofluene in the F344, rat model. The outcome of this work will be the development of novel and reliable methods to produce and isolate 14C-radiolabeled phytoene and phytofluene, in addition to determining the accumulation of phytoene, phytofluene, and their metabolites in the prostate. These novel methods will provide the ability to design both an in vivo cancer prevention trial in an animal model and to develop 13C-labeled carotenoids for human metabolic work."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall research focus of the collaborative team from the University of Illinois and The Ohio State University has been to determine the impact of tomatoes and their bioactive components, especially lycopene, on prostate carcinogenesis. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men and dietary approaches that reduce risk, or delay onset, would have profound impact on public health. Epidemiological and animal studies suggest that consumption of tomato products reduces the risk of prostate cancer. We propose to carry out studies in transgenic mice to determine if the tomato carotenoids, lycopene, phytoene, and phytofluene, or their metabolic products reduce the risk of development and progression of prostate cancer. In order to answer the questions raised in this proposal, we will utilize two new mouse strains that lack one of the two known mammalian carotenoid cleavage enzymes, carotenoid 15, 15' monooxygenase (CMO-I) and carotenoid 9', 10' monooxygenase (CMO-II). The three major specific aims are: 1) delineate the tissue-specific expression of CMO-I and CMO-II in A) wild-type, CMO-I knockout (KO), and CMO-II KO mice in response to short (3 days) and long term (30 days) feeding of different levels of tomato powder or lycopene, and in B) TRAMP mice during the development of carcinogenesis, 2) precisely determine how changes in CMO-I and CMO-II expression dictate A) tissue biodistribution of tomato carotenoids, and B) production of lycopenoids and other tomato carotenoid metabolites, and 3) to investigate the effect of altered tomato carotenoid metabolism on prostate cancer by A) creating double transgenic mice and B) differentiating the ability of dietary tomato powder and lycopene to inhibit prostate cancinogenesis in TRAMP, TRAMP X CMO-I KO, and TRAMP X CMO-II KO mice. We are uniquely qualified to carry out the proposed studies due to our broad expertise with carotenoids and cancer models, access to CMO-I KO and II KO mice, and our ability to biosynthesize radiolabeled tomato carotenoids using tomato cell suspension culture. Our continuing hypothesis is that genetic polymorphisms involved in metabolism of carotenoids, such as CMO-I and II, are critical determinants of the benefits of tomato products against prostate carcinogenesis in humans. These studies will allow us to determine if tomato carotenoids, or their metabolic products, are able to prevent or counteract the development of prostate cancer."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to understand the cellular breadth and impact of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone system. To dissect this large and diverse chaperone network we have exploited high-throughput approaches to identify genetic and physical interactors of the yeast p23 cochaperone Sba1, which serves one branch of the yeast Hsp90 (Hsp82) chaperone system. Unexpectedly, bioinformatic analysis indicates that the Sba1 subnet both overlaps with and is sovereign to the identified Hsp82 network. Notably, a significant share of the Sba1 hits function at or near DNA. Thus, Sba1 appears to extend the role of the Hsp82 system to a variety of nuclear events including transcription, chromatin, telomere and DNA repair pathways. We will focus on telomere and DNA repair paths to better understand how component ts of the Hsp90 system affect nuclear events. To investigate the influence of the Sba1 chaperone we will follow a three-pronged strategy in which a) in vivo assays will be utilized to establish the physiological effect of Sba1 on DNA-related activities; b) genetic phenotypes will be employed to identify functional sba1 alleles; c) the molecular mechanisms of chaperone-regulation on client proteins will be delineated using in vitro assays. Our studies will contribute to the comprehension of how the Hsp90 chaperone network maintains cellular proteostasis and how this broad chaperone system might be dissected by targeting cochaperones to develop more selective therapeutic strategies that are directed at the Hsp90 machinery."

Our proposed work will provide insights into the functional capacity of the Sba1 cochaperone network that likely helps achieve cellular proteostasis and will serve as a resource for developing more selective therapeutic reagents to dissect the Hsp90 chaperone system."
"The long-term objectives of this project are to understand the purpose of dynamic transcription complexesand the mechanisms that promote dissociation of the employed structures.¿The general strategy to be used is to focus on intracellular hormone receptor (IR) mediated transcription,which uses a series of proteins to reach a functional endpoint, and to study the requirement for activedisassembly of the recruited complexes. For example, following hormone binding IRs nucleate multiplestructures at genomic response elements whose coordinated actions lead to the production of specificmRNA transcripts.

"? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objectives are to understand the Hsp90 molecular chaperone system from physiological relevance to mechanistic action. Molecular chaperones are typically identified with the beginning (folding) and ending (degradation) of the protein life cycle. Yet, chaperones in the Hsp90 system are often associated with native proteins including assembled structures. The significance of chaperone interactions with seemingly native proteins is poorly understood. We will exploit our discoveries connecting the Hsp90 system to chromatin modifiers to determine why certain chaperones interact with select native proteins. Our current plans will resolve how molecular chaperones cooperatively modulate multi-subunit protein complexes. To achieve our goal we are exploiting chromatin remodelers as molecular models. In brief, we are investigating the individual and joint regulatory effects of Hsp90 and p23 on nucleosome remodeling process. Our plans will define how Hsp90 controls select chromatin remodelers, will identify the joint impact of Hsp90 and p23 on remodelers, will determine the impact of Hsp90 on the chromatin landscape, and will show how the control of chromatin remodelers by Hsp90 and p23 supports homeostasis."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Botanical estrogens are widely consumed by women with the expectation that they provide a safe, natural source of estrogens to replace the loss of endogenous estrogen in the menopause. Because estrogens can have diverse effects in target cells, including the stimulation of some breast cancers, this unregulated consumption of botanical estrogens might not contribute uniformly to healthy aging. Estrogens regulate gene transcriptional programs and the physiology of many reproductive and non-reproductive tissues, and the mechanisms by which they act are multi-faceted, involving two estrogen receptors, ERa and ER¿, and nuclear-initiated and extra-nuclear-initiated, kinase-mediated pathways. With botanical estrogens, little is known about these mechanistic and cellular aspects. Our overall goal is to use a systems biology approach to provide a molecular and cellular profile of the activity of the botanical estrogens we will be studying, from soy, wild yam, licorice root, and dong quai, to enable determination of whether these botanical estrogens have activities similar to or distinct from estradiol or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). In Aim 1, we will examine the molecular interactions of botanical estrogens with ERa and ER¿ by analysis of ligand binding, conformation and dynamics of the ligand-receptor complexes, and their interaction with key co-regulatory proteins. In Aim 2, we will examine how the patterns of ER and protein kinase recruitment to chromatin binding sites (cistromes) and changes in gene expression (transcriptomes) in target cells are regulated by botanical estrogens through nuclear and extranuclear pathways on a genome-wide basis. In Aim 3, we will generate mechanistic systems biology profiles that relate the cistromes, transcriptomes, and pathway-specific actions of botanical estrogens to their effects on cell functional properties. In this way, we will be able to place cell response to botanical estrogens on a firm mechanistic basis that will allow determination of whether botanical estrogens have similar or unique activities from those of other estrogens and provide fundamental information to inform future clinical studies. Our mechanistic and cellular findings will also be relevant in guiding and interpreting the work in other projects in this P50 program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Little is known about the efficacy and safety of botanical estrogens that are being widely consumed by women for relief from menopausal symptoms. The botanical estrogen systems biology profiles generated through this project will provide crucial mechanistic information and a new conceptual framework for determining whether botanical estrogens have similar or unique activities from those of other estrogens."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall research objective of this Program Project is to evaluate the potential beneficial or detrimental effects of dietary phytoestrogens on breast cancer progression, adipose tissue and the brain, using well-established laboratory animal models. Although phytoestrogens are consumed by older Americans for their perceived beneficial effects, these estrogenic compounds have not been adequately evaluated for safety, despite increasing consumption of these chemicals at high levels, especially among older women. The theme of this Program Project is that dosage, timing, and duration of exposure will all be determinants of the biological outcome of phytoestrogen exposure in different target tissues. Since both potential risks and benefits need to be evaluated, these studies cannot be conducted in humans for ethical reasons and can best be conducted in appropriate pre-clinical laboratory animal models. The proposed studies provide a systematic evaluation of the role that various regimens of phytoestrogen exposure may have on target organs that are of special relevance in aging, and these studies will also seek to determine the mechanism of phytoestrogen effects on these different target tissues. In summary, the overall goal of the P01 is to conduct highly interactive investigations of the effects of phytoestrogen dietary exposure using well established animal models, each having specific advantages for the study of: breast cancer progression to hormone independence, obesity and risk of diabetes, and cognitive function. This goal will be achieved through four complementary, synergistic projects: (1) Genistein and Endocrine Resistance in Breast Tumors, (2) Dietary Phytoestrogens and Adipocyte Development, (3) Dietary Estrogens and Cognitive Function During Aging, and (4) Phytoestrogen Action Through Estrogen Receptors alpha and beta. Investigators will be aided by an Administrative Core that oversees inter-project meetings and provides budgetary, reporting and external advisory needs, an Analytical and Bioavailability Core that will provide analysis and standardization of blood and tissue isoflavone levels for projects 1-3, and a Dietary, Genomics and Chemistry Synthesis Core that will provide uniform diets, gene expression profiling analysis by microarray and quantitative PCR methods, and chemical synthesis of phytoestrogens and phytoestrogen metabolites."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risk of breast increases with age and the majority of breast cancers are estrogen (E)-responsive. Approximately 75% of women with breast cancer are over 50 years old. Therefore, most women with breast cancer are postmenopausal. If a woman has E-responsive breast cancer it is likely that she is receiving antiestrogen tamoxifen (TAM) therapy. Considerable research has focused on the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) by women with E-responsive breast cancer and most oncologists/physicians do not recommend HRT to these women. However, there has been a dramatic increase in soy and estrogenic isoflavone consumption by postmenopausal women with breast cancer as a natural and perceived 'safe' alternative to HRT. This 'self-medication' with dietary estrogenic isoflavones for relief of menopausal and TAM-associated menopause-like symptoms is often done without their physician's knowledge. The safety of the dietary estrogenic isoflavones for women with E-responsive breast cancer and the potential for these phytoestrogens to negate the effectiveness of TAM therapy is a potential risk that has not been adequately evaluated. Our preliminary results indicate that the dietary genistein, the predominate isoflavone present in soy and isoflavone-containing supplements, can negate/overwhelm the inhibitory effects of TAM on E-stimulated tumor growth in athymic mice. In our proposed experiments, we will determine the minimum dietary dosage of genistein that can negate/overwhelm the inhibitory effects of TAM. Additionally, 30-40% of women consuming isoflavones can produce equol by enteric metabolism in the large intestine. This estrogenic metabolite can add to the dietary estrogen load and potentially increase breast cancer nsk in women (equol-producers) that consume isoflavones. We have developed a cost-effective method to convert formononetin to equol for use in both in vitro and in vivo tumor growth studies. This will allow us, for the first time, the ability to evaluate the interaction of equol with genistein and determine if this adds sufficient estrogenic activity to negate/overwhelm the inhibitory effects of TAM on E-stimulated tumor growth. In summary, our studies will determine if dietary estrogenic isoflavones and metabolites at physiologically relevant dietary dosages can negate/overwhelm the inhibitory effects of TAM on E-stimulated breast cancer growth."
"Consumption of dietary soy has been associated with reduction in risk of several chronic diseases, such as: cardiovascular disease, osteopenia in post-menopausal women, and several types of cancers. Soy contains many phytochemicals including phytates, saponins, protease inhibitors, fiber, phytosterols, phenolic compounds, and isoflavones. Many of these phytochemicals may be involved in the health beneficial effects associated with soy consumption. Soy contains high levels of the isoflavone genistein and considerable research has been conducted to relate the beneficial health effects from consumption of soy with genistein. However, genistein is a known phytoestrogen and the possibility that consumption of diets high in genistein may be detrimental to women at risk for estrogen-dependent breast cancer requires evaluation. We have demonstrated that dietary consumption of genistein results in: growth of implanted estrogen-dependent human breast cancer (MCF-7) cell tumors in ovariectomized athymic mice, enhancement of mammary development and uterotrophic effects in ovariectomized rodents and stimulation of growth of cultured MCF-7 cells at low concentrations of genistein. We hypothesize that various forms of dietary genistein will produce blood and tumor concentrations of genistein sufficient to stimulate growth of estrogen-dependent human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we are proposing to conduct a series of feeding studies to determine the potential of various levels of dietary genistein to stimulate growth of MCF-7) cell tumors implanted into ovariectomized athymic female mice. We will also evaluate the interaction of genistein with estradiol for its potential to alter growth rate of MCF-7 cell tumors in athymic mice. An evaluation of dietary genistin, the glycoside in legumes, for its potential to enhance tumor growth in ovariectomized athymic mice will be conducted. We will also compare diets containing genistein with diets containing soy protein isolates with equal contents of genistein to evaluate the interaction of genistein with other compounds in soy. Results of the proposed studies will elucidate the role of genistein from soy on growth of estrogen-dependent tumors in vivo."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The US population is becoming obese, which in turn is increasing the incidence of many chronic diseases. Emerging information suggests a strong association between obesity and increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Adipose tissue is a source of chronic low-level inflammatory cytokines and recent work suggests that inflammation acts as a promoter to enhance liver cancer. Broccoli contains precursors to sulforaphane, which has both anti- inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties, as well as indole-3-carbinol, which has some anti-carcinogenic properties. Yet there are no studies of prevention of obesity-derived inflammation or HCC by dietary broccoli or broccoli sprouts. We hypothesize that whereas diet-induced obesity speeds the development of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC, incorporation of broccoli, and to a lesser extent, broccoli sprouts in the diet will counter the impact of obesity by inhibiting inflammation and carcinogenesis. Specifically, we aim to: 1) establish the high fat diet (HFD)-induced DEN mouse model of HCC and follow development through preneoplasia to carcinoma formation, 2) evaluate the impact of whole, freeze-dried broccoli, broccoli sprouts (containing no indoles), broccoli sprouts plus indole-3-carbinol (I3C), I3C alone or no additions, on preneoplasia and on HCC. The significance of this work is that it will show if broccoli, with both sulforaphane and indoles, is more or less effective than broccoli sprouts, when the two are balanced for dietary provision of sulforaphane. Most work in this area focuses on sulforaphane and broccoli sprouts, a few laboratories focus on indole-3-carbinol, but very little is known about the impact of the whole vegetable, broccoli, the most common component in our diet."

Yet very few studies have looked at dietary control of this - and no studies have looked at the impact of the anti-carcinogenic food broccoli. Here we propose to establish a model of dietary obesity-enhanced liver cancer and gain preliminary data on a comparison between the impact of broccoli and broccoli sprouts on obesity-induced inflammation, preneoplasia and hepatocellular carcinoma."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antiestrogens and SERMs (selective estrogen receptor modulators) such as tamoxifen and raloxifene are the most widely used agents in the treatment of hormone-responsive breast cancer and have proved to be very effective in breast cancer prevention. They are likely to play increasingly important roles in menopausal hormone replacement therapy as well. While it has long been known that the estrogen receptor (ER) is required for the actions of estrogens and SERMs, it is increasingly appreciated that the activity of the ER and the tissue selectivity of SERMs are markedly influenced by coregulator proteins. Also, the action of ER influences the expression pattern of a remarkable number of genes through a diversity of modes. In this project, we will combine modern technologies in an innovative two-pronged approach to understanding the molecular basis of SERM action: (a) a targeted investigation of the role of an ER-specific coregulator, REA (repressor of estrogen receptor activity), through the development of an REA knockout mouse, together with comparative studies on the influence of other corepressors in the action of SERMs, and (b) a global analysis of gene regulation by SERMs using microarrays, together with complementary bioinformatic, molecular, and biochemical analyses of regulated function. This research should provide a clearer understanding of the gene networks through which SERMs act, the cellular factors that determine SERM effectiveness and tissue selectivity, and the gene-regulating activities that contribute to their beneficial anti-proliferative and tumor suppressive actions in breast cancer treatment and prevention, and provide the optimal balance of tissue selective activities for hormone replacement therapy."
"Antiestrogens (AEs) are the most widely used agents for the treatment of hormone-responsive breast cancer, and the AE tamoxifen has also proven to be effective in preventing breast cancer. AEs are also unique ligands useful for understanding the tissue selective actions of certain estrogens, an important issue in menopausal hormone replacement therapy, and for probing the intriguing pharmacology of the two estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes, ERalpha and ERbeta, and their roles in breast cancer and other estrogen target cells. In this application, we are proposing to investigate two new aspects of the action of AEs. The first aspect deals with the ability of certain proteins (denoted PAAs for 'Potentiators of Antiestrogen Activity') that we have identified recently, to enhance the potency of AEs as inhibitors of estrogens. The levels and activity of these small, estrogen receptor-selective proteins could account for the differential tissue selectivity of AEs and for the ability of ER-containing breast tumors to be either highly sensitive, or resistant to AE therapy. We propose to identify and characterize PAAs, by examining their roles as modulators of AE action in target cells and determinants of hormonal resistance in breast cancer, by elucidating their interaction domains with ER, their subcellular distribution, and their interaction with other ER coregulators, and by performing structural analyses on PAA-ER complexes. The second aspect also derives from our recent work in which we have found that certain antioxidant/cytoprotective genes are upregulated by AEs and inhibited by estrogens. We propose to identify and analyze the regulation of genes selectively upregulated by AEs, by searching for other genes that are AE stimulated and estrogen suppressed, by analyzing the gene regulatory regions mediating the selective activation by AEs, by determining the ERalpha and ERbeta selectivity of this regulation, and by examining whether other antioxidant genes involved in cytoprotection against reactive oxygen species are upregulated by AEs. The studies we propose should provide significant new insight into how AEs act, what cellular factors determine their effectiveness and tissue selectivity, and how their gene regulating activities contribute to their beneficial antiproliferative, tumor suppressive, and cytoprotective actions in breast cancer treatment and prevention."
"Antiestrogens (AEs), intriguing compounds that are able to antagonize many of the actions of estrogens, are of particular medical importance because of their efficacy In controlling the growth and spread of hormone-responsive breast and uterine tumors. Our objective is to understand the mechanism by which AEs interact with the estrogen receptor and are effective as estrogen antagonists. Our studies address the question of estrogen antagonist action at two levels: ligand-receptor interaction and receptor-receptor interaction (dimerization). Our specific aims are to identify the ligand discriminating site in the estrogen receptor through site-directed and random mutagenesis and biocharacter screening, and to investigate the role of receptor dimerization in AE action through the use of bivalent ligands and a dimer contact peptide. Based upon results from our affinity labeling studies, we will prepare a set of mutant estrogen receptors in which carefully controlled substitutions of specific amino acids are made in those regions In the hormone binding domain-E thought to be the most critically involved in distinguishing between estrogen agonists and antagonists, a site we term the ligand discriminating site. Conservative amino acid substitutions will be made, so as to maintain estrogen receptor structure and ligand binding but to change the interaction that the altered domain might have with the basic and polar side chains of AEs. Additional affinity labeling studies using new derivatives of AEs will be conducted to obtain further information on the contact sites between estrogen receptor and the basic side chains of the AEs. In complementary studies, we will use random mutagenesis of selected portions of estrogen receptor cDNA and biocharacter screening in yeast to identify further the residues important in determining agonist/ antagonist character. We will prepare and evaluate the agonist/antagonist potency of bivalent AE and estrogen ligands and their effects on the monomer-dimer equilibrium of receptor. We will also synthesize a dimer contact oligopeptide and determine if it blocks receptor dimerization and alters transactivation. The implications of progress in this area include the development of improved AEs, a greater understanding of the .effectiveness of AEs in treatment of hormone-responsive breast cancer, and elucidation of aspects of ligand character recognition and the regulation of transcription by AEs and estrogens."

"DESCRIPTION: The P.I. is investigating a novel method for the functional inactivation of estrogen receptors (ERs) in estrogen- dependent human breast cancer cells based on the use of potent dominant negative (DN) ER mutants. The P.I. has generated several potent DN-ERs and shown that they inhibit estrogen-stimulated gene expression and proliferation of breast cancer cells. The present proposal focuses on two critical advances made during this work: 1 the identification by 2-hybrid interaction cloning of a novel corepressor protein, denoted REA for repressor of estrogen action. REA selectively enhance the potency of DN-ERs, while having very little effect on wild type ER and no effect on other nuclear receptors. 2) The development of a system for generating targeted DN-ERs which bind with high affinity and selectivity to specific hormone response elements. The Specific Aims are: 1) To analyze the molecular mechanisms by which the corepressor REA is recruited by DN-ERs and potentiates their activity. Physica and functional mapping of DN-ER/REA interaction will be carried out using GST pull-down methods, mammalian 2-hybrid transactivation assays and mutational analyses. Using antibodies to REA, and antisense methodology, intracellular RE will be neutralized/eliminated and the functional importance of the DN-ER/REA interaction will be defined in intact cells. The P.I. will identify additional REA interaction partners which may potentiate corepressor activity, and characterize the effect of REA on ER cellular distribution. 2) To search for other dominant negative corepressors, the P.I. will use 2-hybrid interaction cloning with the two most potent DN-ERs. 3) To optimize receptor-corepressor interaction, 2-hybrid screening with REA will be used to screen ER mutant libraries for mutants exhibiting enhanced corepressor binding. 4) To assess the roles of the c-myc, TGFa and cathepsin D genes in the proliferation and invasiveness of ER positive breast cancer cells, the modified P22 challenge phage system will be used to create DN-ERs that bind selectively and with high affinity to the different non-consensus EREs found in each of these genes. The P.I. will introduce the gene- selective DN-ERs into cells using her efficient adenovirus system, determine their effects on gene expression, and examine their importance in ER regulated breast cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness."
"We will develop and investigate a novel method for functional inactivation of estrogen receptor (ER) in estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cells. Our approach is based on dominant negative mutants. These are ER mutants which are inactive on their own, but are able to suppress the activity of wild-type ER when they are co-expressed in the same cells. Our Specific Aims are: (1) To generate more powerful dominant negative mutants of ER; (2) To determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for the effectiveness of the mutants; (3) To use the dominant negative mutants to block estrogen-dependent growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in nude mice. In preliminary studies we generated three effective and ER-specific dominant negative mutants. These mutants appear to function by inactivation of the C-terminal transactivation domain of ER. We will generate even more potent mutants by replacing both the C- and N-terminal transactivation domains. We will use the P22 challenge phage system to generate ER mutants with enhanced binding to the estrogen response element. These mutations, which lead to increased ability to compete for binding to the estrogen response element, will be introduced into dominant negative mutants with inactive transactivation domains to produce extremely potent dominant negative mutants. We will determine the relative contributions of competition for binding to the estrogen response element, formation of heterodimers, and interference with ER-specific components of the transcription apparatus to the activity of our most effective dominant negative mutants. The ability of our most powerful dominant negative mutants to block estrogen-dependent growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells will be evaluated. Stably transfected cells producing the dominant negative mutant ERs will be tested for suppression of estrogen-stimulated growth in and for suppression of the expression of some growth factors and proteins thought to be important in ER-stimulated growth and tumorigenicity. We will use stably transfected MCF-7 cells expressing a potent dominant negative mutant from a regulated promoter to initiate estrogen-dependent growth of MCF-7 tumors in athymic nude mice. Then we will activate production of the dominant negative mutant, and determine if growth of the tumors is blocked or reversed. These studies should provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of ER action and the proliferation and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells, and allow evaluation of a novel approach for the suppression of estrogen-dependent breast cancer growth."

We will use stably transfected MCF-7 cells expressing a potent dominant negative mutant from a regulated promoter to initiate estrogen-dependent growth of MCF-7 tumors in athymic nude mice. Then we will activate production of the dominant negative mutant, and determine if growth of the tumors is blocked or reversed. These studies should provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of ER action and the proliferation and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells, and allow evaluation of a novel approach for the suppression of estrogen-dependent breast cancer growth."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) are major regulators of hormone-responsive breast and prostate cancers, and they function as targets for endocrine therapies and as biomarkers having very significant prognostic and predictive values. The overall goal of this project is to advance positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging of specific nuclear hormone receptors and receptor function to improve the management and treatment of breast and prostate cancer patients. While some PET imaging agents have been developed by us for the estrogen receptor (ER) and the androgen receptor (AR), the current status of PET imaging of NHR levels and function in breast and prostate cancer is rather underdeveloped, and many opportunities lie ahead. Our current aims are to: (1) Develop a Progesterone Receptor (PR) PET imaging hormone-challenge test to improve prediction of success of endocrine therapy in breast Cancer. Two PR PET imaging agents, the [18F]FFNP and [18F]FPTP will be studied in xenografts and murine mammary tumor models of ER-positive endocrine-sensitive and endocrine-resistant breast cancer. Hormone treatment protocols will be developed to optimize a 1-day estradiol challenge test for ER function, based on an acute change in PR-PET, to obtain a rapid, accurate and robust prediction of breast cancer hormone responsiveness. (2) Evaluate Fluorine-18 labeled ligands for the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR?) as PET imaging agents of predictive value for prostate cancer recurrence. PPAR? levels measured by IHC in a nested case-control human prostate cancer tissue array resource will be examined for their predictive power for risk of recurrence. The uptake efficiency and selectivity of two F-18 labeled PPAR? ligands will be studied in preclinical models of prostate cancer to develop PPAR? PET imaging protocols for suspected primary prostate cancer that can distinguish aggressive from indolent disease and improve prediction of the risk of disease recurrence. (3) Design PET imaging agents for the Estrogen Related Receptor alpha (ERR?) to develop a novel ERR? PET-Imaging test of prognostic and predictive value in hormone-responsive and unresponsive breast cancer. Fluorine-substituted analogs of high affinity ERR? ligands will be prepared and labeled with fluorine-18 rapidly, at high specific activity. Their biodistribution will then be evaluated in preclinical models of ERR?-positive breast cancers to develop ERR? as a predictive marker for novel therapies for both ER-positive and negative breast cancers."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective management of breast cancer requires early diagnosis, accurate staging, prediction of the responsiveness to endocrine therapy, and early determination of therapeutic response. The role of the estrogen receptor (ER) as a predictive marker in breast cancer is well recognized, as is the effectiveness of hormonal agents such as the antiestrogen tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole for treating certain cancers. The overall goal of this project-to improve the diagnosis and treatment of hormone- responsive breast cancer-is organized around three specific aims: (1) Develop Imaging Agents Specific for ERa and ERft: The ERa subtype in breast tumors is generally found together with the more recently discovered ERp subtype, which is thought to have a restraining effect on the proliferative drive of ERa. Thus, it is important to determine both ERa and ERp levels in breast tumors by imaging. We have selected two clinically promising ERp-selective ligands for labeling with F-18 or Br-76 for PET imaging of ERp in breast tumors. We will also prepare an ERa ligand with enhanced characteristics for imaging, using a diaryliodonium salt approach for introducing F-18 into phenols. (2) Develop Tc-99m Labeled Breast Tumor Imaging Agents: To make imaging of ER in breast tumors more readily accessible and less expensive, we will prepare ER ligands labeled with Tc-99m. The large radiometal will be accommodated in a manner that does not interfere with receptor binding by using recently developed methods to place a tricarbonyltechnetium organometallic unit into the interior of a non-steroidal ligand, producing compact metal- integrated ligands that have high affinity for the ER. This approach for integrated ligand design could be of general utility for nuclear receptor radiopharmaceutical development. (3) Develop ER-Guided Radiotherapeutic Agents: Estrogens labeled with Auger-emitting radionuclides have promise as ER-guided radiotherapy agents, because ER binds to gene regulatory sites in chromatin. To develop such an agent, we have selected for labeling with bromine radioisotopes an ER ligand that has both very high affinity and very low non-specific binding ER ligands, giving it the long target tissue retention needed for radiotherapy. The work we propose on the three components of this project should lead to improved methods for breast cancer diagnosis and therapy. Relevance: The estrogen receptor is a well recognized prognostic factor and therapeutic target for breast cancer. The aim of this project is to develop specialized radioactive agents (radiopharmaceuticals) to image this receptor non-invasively and to direct radiotoxic isotopes specifically to receptor-containing cancers. These agents could improve the selection of patients for individualized and optimized hormone therapy, sparing them the morbidity associated with standard radiation and chemotherapy which would provide them with no further benefit."
"Most breast tumors contain estrogen receptors (ER) that regulate tumor cell growth and mediate the action of estrogen antagonists such as tamoxifen. Not all breast cancers, however, respond to hormone therapy. Therefore, it is important to have effective prognostic tools that will identify those patients most likely to be hormone responders, so that they can be treated with this well tolerated therapy, whereas those unlikely to respond can promptly begin regimens of radiation of chemotherapy. The presence of ER in most breast tumors provides a mechanism for selective localization of estrogens, which if labeled with suitable radionuclides, could be used for diagnostic imaging or radiotherapy or breast tumors. During past periods of support on this project, we have developed a series of estrogens labeled with fluorine-18 and carbon-11, some of which are effective agents of imaging estrogen receptor positive (ER+) tumors. Other investigators have developed other adiohalogenated estrogens for ER-mediated radiotherapy. Other investigators have developed other radiohalogenated estrogens for ER-mediated radiotherapy. Also, recent investigations have revealed that another estrogen receptor subtype, ERbeta, is present in some target tissues, including breast tissue and tumors. We have three goals of the next phase of this project: (1) We intend to develop ER ligands for breast tumor imaging that are labeled with the readily available radionuclide, technetium-99m, as well as its rhenium congener. To accomplish this, we will investigate novel aspects of technetium organometallic chemistry through the application of three new methods for the preparation of cyclopentadienyl tricarbonyl technetium and related systems. These functionalities will be incorporated are pendant and integral groups into steroidal and non-steroidal ER ligands. (2) Based on emerging differences in the structure-binding affinity relationships for ERalpha and ERbeta ligands, derived in part from our investigations, we will prepare ligands selective for these receptors and develop them as tumor imaging agents. (3) We will utilize several radionuclides (iodine-123, and 124 and bromine-76, 77, the later three available to use through a collaboration to prepare ER ligands for radiotherapy,, and we will have these tested in appropriate animal tumor model systems. These investigations should lead to substantial advances in the availability of diagnostic imaging gents for ER+ tumors and ER subtype- selective imaging agents, to the evaluation in vivo of radiotherapeutic ER ligands."
"The estrogen receptor present in many breast tumors offers a mechanism by which estrogens, suitably labeled with appropriate radionuclides, might be taken up and retained selectively, thereby providing an image of the tumor. We have succeeded in preparing estrogens labeled with the positron- emitting radionuclide fluorine-18, and we have demonstrated that receptor- positive primary breast tumors, affected axillary lymph nodes, and metastatic tumors can be imaged very effectively. We have also improved the sensitivity of these agents by enhancing their binding selectivity (specific to non-specific binding ratio), through the incorporation of substituents known to raise receptor binding or lower lipophilicity, and by controlling their metabolism and clearance. Such agents could provide in estrogen receptor-positive tumors a characterization of the hormone receptivity of the cancer in situ (useful prognostic information on the likelihood of response to endocrine therapy) and a functional staging of the disease (information that may be important in selection of the most appropriate surgical interventions and follow-up therapy). The primary aim of the studies in the present application is to make a major extension of this methodology to the more widely available radionuclide technetium-99m, by carefully designing metal bis-amine bis- thiol complexes that are close structural mimics of high affinity steroidal and non-steroidal ligands for the estrogen receptor; the design is based on a novel superposition of molecular templates derived from metal complex geometry with steroidal and non-steroidal ligands. The second aim of the studies in this application are to develop methods for the synthesis of estrogens labeled with carbon-11. These agents are designed to have high receptor binding affinity and enhanced rates of clearance, so that good images can be obtained with this short-lived radionuclide, minimizing radiation dose to the patient and permitting repeat studies in one sitting that might assist in quantitation of estrogen receptor levels in tumors. All of these agents will be evaluated in terms of their estrogen binding affinity, their non-specific binding and affinity for certain serum binding proteins, and their tissue distribution in rats. The development of these novel agents for diagnostic imaging of estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors should extend and refine the process of staging of the cancer in individual patients, providing a more convenient and complete assessment of the degree of spread and the hormonal responsiveness of the cancer, and a more accurate prognosis for the effectiveness of various alternative forms of treatment."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Estrogens, acting through the estrogen receptors, ER? and ER?, control many physiological and pathological processes in numerous target tissues. While progress has been made in developing ER ligands having more desirable patterns of selective activity, such as selective ER modulators (SERMs) and ER-subtype selective ligands, the diversity of modes and pathways through which the ERs act offers intriguing but as yet unexplored mechanisms through which one should be able to obtain new compounds having higher levels of desired selectivity. Our overall goal is to develop potent ER ligands optimized to deliver the full range of desired, long sought-after selectivity in three medically important areas, achieved by three distinct mechanisms: (A) brain neuroprotection mediated through ER? with carefully selected ligands of novel structure; (B) cardiovascular protection afforded by selective activation of extranuclear-initiated ER signaling pathways by estrogen-dendrimer conjugates (EDCs) and small molecules of novel design; and (C) combined anti-proliferative/anti-inflammatory activity as optimized therapy for estrogen-dependent breast cancer and endometriosis, through unique ER conformations induced by structurally novel ligands. Each effort is centered on a distinct mechanistic paradigm and is supported by active, ongoing collaborations with established research groups that should lead to excellent opportunities for further pre-clinical development. Aims: (1) Develop Novel ER? Ligands Having Selective Brain Neuroprotective Activities. A subset of our ER? ligands, acting through an endogenous autocrine anti-inflammatory pathway, is neuroprotective and is active in animal models of multiple sclerosis, reversing established disease. We will develop structure-activity relationships to enhance potency and selectivity of these novel compounds. (2) Develop Novel Pathway-Specific ER Ligands that Afford Selective Vascular, Cardiac, and Bone Protection. Our EDC blocks hormone entry into the nucleus and activates only the extranuclear-initiated ER signaling pathway, yet it provides cardiovascular protection equivalent to that of estradiol without stimulation of uterus or breast tumors. We will develop orally active conjugates with highly stable dendrimers and carefully designed small molecules having pathway selectivity. (3) Develop Novel ER Ligands that Combine Anti- Inflammatory and Anti-Proliferative Activities for Improved Therapy for Endocrine-Resistant Breast Cancers and Endometriosis. Our 3-dimensional ER ligands stabilize a previously unseen ER conformation and inhibit hormone-resistant breast cancer lines and endometriotic lesions. Using structure-guided design, we will develop higher potency and more selective compounds."

"The aims of this project are (1) to understand the molecular basis of the diverse pharmacology of estrogens, including the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and antiestrogens, (2) to develop novel inhibitors of estrogen action that act by blocking receptor-coactivator interactions, and (3) to prepare protein microarrays that can be used to study how ligands regulate nuclear receptor-coregulator interactions on a genome-wide basis.

Using structure-based and de novo design, we will develop small molecule coactivator binding inhibitorsthat should block estrogen action at a different level than antiestrogens and might overcome antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer. Protein microarrays of nuclear hormone receptors or coregulators will be developed to assay ligand regulation of receptor-coregulator interaction in a rapid, high throughput, genome-wide manner. This project should lead to improved understanding of the molecular basis of estrogen action, novel agents to regulate estrogen activity, and powerful tools for the discovery of novel estrogens and other ligands for nuclear receptors."

"The estrogen receptor is a multidomain, ligand-activated transcription factor; while the structure of the DNA-binding domain is known in detail from NMR and X-ray studies, the structure of the hormone binding domain is so far unknown. The overall goal of this project is to determine the 3-D structure of this domain, using three approaches that operate in a synergistic fashion: (a) the expression of the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER-HBD) in chemically pure and conformationally homogeneous form, (b)the use of specific chemical probes and expression of defined fragments to study structure and function, and (c) the application of computational modeling methods. As Specific Aim I, we will use the pTrxFus vector in E. coli to express the ER N304-S554 sequence (that represents the core of the ER-HBD), and we will use electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to certify the identity and chemical purity of the expressed material, which has proved to be a problem in many cases. In Specific Aim 2, we will use this material to obtain topological information on the ER-HBD, by affinity labeling to identify ligand contact sites in the HBD and by residue specific modification to identify exposed sites, and we will probe the core structure of the ER-HBD by expressing HBD fragments and subdomain structural elements, following structure formation by circular dichroism (CD) and function by ligand binding. As Specific Aim 3, we will use advanced computational homology modeling approaches to predict and refine a 3-D structural model of the ER-HBD, using energy-based and pattern recognition methods and testing consistency with results from our own studies; we will use this model to evaluate ligand binding specificity for structure-based design and to plan specificity re-engineering experiments by subdomain swapping. As Specific Aim 4, we will prepare isotopically labeled ligands and ER-HBD core structural fragments for NMR studies, to be done in collaboration with A. J. Wand, Dept. Biochemistry. For X-ray analysis to be done with A. Wang, Depts. Cell and Structural Biology, and Chemistry, we will use preparations that are chemically pure and conformationally homogeneous, and contain heavy atoms in the protein or complexed ligand. We anticipate that these studies, which combine synthetic chemical, biochemical, molecular biological, and (through collaborations) advanced computational modeling, NMR and X-ray structural analysis, will lead to significant advances in our understanding of the structure of the estrogen receptor and its interaction with estrogen hormones."

"SummaryObesity has become a global epidemic and greatly increases the risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease,and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Nearly 80% of obese people develop NAFLD, whichprogresses to steatohepatitis (NASH) and further to end-stage liver diseases, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, andliver cancer, but good therapeutic options to treat NAFLD are not available. The hallmark of NAFLD isabnormal accumulation of triglyceride (TG) in the liver due to dysregulated lipid metabolism. Bile acids(BAs) are recently recognized signaling molecules that profoundly impact metabolism and counteractobesity. The BA-induced intestinal hormone, FGF15/19 (mFGF15. hFGF19), has received great attentionbecause its lipid-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects and, thus, its therapeutic potential in treatingobesity and diabetes. However, little is known about how FGF15/19 controls lipid metabolism. The overallgoal of this application is to determine how an orphan nuclear receptor Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP,NR0B2) mediates postprandial actions of FGF15/19 by epigenetic regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism.We have preliminary data showing that FGF19 treatment induced recruitment of DNA methyltransferase-3a(DNMT3a) to key lipogenic genes in a SHP-dependent manner, and liver-specific downregulation of SHP orDNMT3a led to decreased 5-methyl cytosine (5mC) DNA levels at these genes and increased liver TGlevels, suggesting a novel function of SHP and DNMT3a in hepatic lipogenesis. Based these excitingpreliminary data, we hypothesize that SHP physiologically mediates epigenetic repression of hepaticlipogenesis by recruiting DNMT3a, in response to FGF15 signaling in the late fed-state, but this FGF15-SHP-DNMT3a regulatory axis is disrupted in obesity. To test this hypothesis, we will 1) determine the roleand the underlying mechanisms of how the FGF15-SHP-DNMT3a regulatory axis mediates epigeneticrepression of hepatic lipogenic genes, and then, 2) investigate the in vivo function of hepatic SHP andDNMT3a in regulation of liver lipid metabolism, focusing on de novo lipogenesis, and dysregulation of thisregulatory axis in obesity in mice and determine human relevance by analysis of liver samples from NAFLDpatients. To achieve these goals, multifaceted approaches, including molecular/biochemical, metabolic,and epigenetic studies and global genomic analyses, will be utilized in SHP-LKO and FGF15-KO mice, andmouse models generated by viral-mediated expression and downregulation of proteins.Impact: Our expertise on transcriptional and epigenetic control of liver lipid metabolism by nuclearreceptors uniquely qualifies us to carry out this project. This proposal will test whether SHP and DNMT3amediate FGF15/19 actions in hepatic lipid metabolism, and may reveal effective approaches for developingnew therapeutic targets for NAFLD and diagnostic biomarkers to monitor its progression."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to understand the role of bile acids as recently recognized key signaling molecules that control integrative metabolism and energy balance and the dysfunction of this regulatory pathway in obesity and related diseases. Obesity is a growing epidemic worldwide. Fatty liver (steatosis) that develops in obese people increases the risk for diabetes, heart disease, and even, liver cancer. The role of insulin in the regulation of metabolism has been extensively studied, but little is known about how BA signaling is integrated to control hepatic metabolism. Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP) has been implicated as a key player in BA signaling pathways. In response to bile acid signaling, SHP mediates the epigenetic repression of Cyp7a1, the rate-limiting bile acid biosynthetic gene, by coordinately recruiting histone-modifying proteins (histone methylases and deacetylases) to the promoter. Further, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of SHP itself regulates its level and activity in the liver. These previous studies, however, did not address thekey questions of how the PTM of SHP and the epigenetic histone modifications are regulated in response to BA signaling and how this regulation is altered in pathology, such as fatty liver disease. Answering these questions is the specific goal of the current proposal. Surprisingly, preliminary studies have revealed a role for protein kinase C-zeta (PKC?) in regulating SHP activity in response to bile acid signaling by phosphorylating Thr-55 of SHP which is critical for SHP-repression activity and is a key event upstream of other known PTMs of SHP that control its stability and activity. Notably, PKC? is a negative regulator of obesity-induced inflammation and hepatic steatosis, thus, phosphorylation of SHP by PKC? may be critically involved in bile acid-regulated hepatic metabolism. Based on these studies, we hypothesize that SHP functions as a key epigenetic coordinator in bile acid-regulated hepatic metabolism and that bile acid signaling-induced PTMs of SHP, particularly phosphorylation by PKC?, are critical to its hepatic functions, but, in obesity, PTMs of SHP and SHP-mediated epigenetic regulation are dysregulated, contributing to abnormal hepatic metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize in vitro and in vivo studies using transgenic and obese mouse models, cultured hepatic cells, and human liver hepatocyes or tissue from normal or fatty liver disease patients. Our specific aims are to: 1) define the role of PTMs of SHP induced by BA signaling (BA or FGF19) in normal hepatic metabolism, focusing on phosphorylation by PKC?? 2) determine whether SHP functions as a key epigenetic coordinator of bile acid responsive hepatic genes, including analyzing global genomic binding sites of SHP and bile acid-mediated epigenetic gene regulation, and 3) investigate whether PTMs of SHP, global SHP binding sites, and SHP-mediated epigenetic events are altered in fatty livers, contributing to metabolic abnormalities in obesity. These studies will elucidate how SHP epigenetically controls BA-regulated hepatic functions, and identify novel potential diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excess amounts of cholesterol and bile acids are associated with metabolic diseases, such as atherosclerosis and cholestatic liver disease. The overall aim of this project is to understand how cholesterol and bile acid levels are regulated by an orphan nuclear receptor and transcriptional repressor, small heterodimer partner (SHP), which is emerging as a critical metabolic regulator. Cholesterol conversion to bile acids represents a major route for elimination of cholesterol from the body, and cholesterol 71 hydroxylase (CYP7A1) plays a key role in this process. Bile acids feedback-inhibit transcription of CYP7A1 by activating multiple signaling pathways, including SHP induction by the bile acid receptor FXR, cell kinase signaling, and FGF15/19 gut-liver signaling pathway and SHP has been implicated as a key downstream regulator in all these inhibitory pathways. In preliminary studies, we have obtained data supporting the hypothesis that bile acids not only induce SHP expression, but also increase the stability and activity of SHP by inhibiting proteasomal degradation and increasing sumoylation of SHP via upstream phosphorylation events. Further, we propose that the stability and activity of SHP are also regulated by a potential agonist, 3-Cl-AHPC. To test these hypotheses, we will: 1) Define of the role of ubiquitination-proteasomal degradation of SHP in bile acid signaling. 2) Investigate the role of SHP sumoylation in SHP repression activity. 3) Delineate how the activity and stability of SHP are regulated by 3-Cl-AHPC in hepatic cells. Since SHP plays a critical role in normal physiology and also in disease processes, our studies to define how the hepatic activity of SHP is modulated by bile acids, FGF15/19, and its ligands may reveal novel molecular targets for treating metabolic disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Excess amounts of cholesterol and bile acids are associated with metabolic diseases, such as atherosclerosis and cholestatic liver disease. Bile acids cause an increase in the amount of small heterodimer partner (SHP) in liver cells which then inhibits the breakdown of cholesterol to bile acids. The overall aim of this project is to understand how cholesterol and bile acid levels are regulated by SHP. It is known that bile acids increase the synthesis of SHP, but it is not known whether the stability and activity of SHP are also affected by bile acids. These studies will examine whether and how bile acids and bile acid-induced intestinal FGF-19, and a potential SHP ligand, 3-Cl-AHPC, affect the stability and activity of SHP in liver cells. These studies will help us understand how SHP activity is modulated and may suggest new approaches for treating metabolic diseases."
"AbstractExcess amounts of cholesterol and bile acids are associated with metabolic diseases, such asatherosclerosis and cholestatic liver disease. The overall aim of this project is to understand howcholesterol and bile acid levels are regulated by an orphan nuclear receptor, small heterodimer partner(SHP), which is emerging as a critical regulator of hepatic metabolic pathways. Cholesterol conversion tobile acids represents a major route for elimination of cholesterol from the body, and cholesterol 7ahydroxylase (CYP7A1) plays a key role in this process. Increased bile acids repress transcription ofCYP7A1 by activating the FXR/SHP nuclear receptor cascade and by activating kinase signaling andfibroblast growth factor 15 signaling pathways which may also involve SHP. We have demonstrated thatSHP inhibits CYP7A1 transcription by coordinately recruiting chromatin modifying cofactors to the promoterafter bile acid treatment, resulting in chromatin remodeling and gene repression. However, how SHP andits chromatin cofactors are assembled and recruited to the promoter and whether multiple bile acidactivatedkinase signaling pathways affect these processes by modulating post-translational modificationsof SHP remain unknown. In preliminary studies, we have obtained exciting new data supporting thehypothesis that bile acids not only induce SHP expression via FXR, but also increase the stability andactivity of SHP by inhibiting proteasomal degradation and increasing sumoylation of SHP via upstreamphosphorylation events. Further, we propose that both the stability and activity of SHP are also regulatedby its ligands. To test these hypotheses, we will: 1) Define of the role of proteasomal degradation of SHP inbile acid signaling. 2) Investigate the role of SHP sumoylation in the regulation of SHP stability and activity.3) Delineate how SHP activity is modulated by its potential ligands. Our studies to define how SHP activityis modulated by bile acids and its ligands will help us understand the mechanism of SHP action and mayreveal molecular targets for treating metabolic and other diseases in which SHP plays a key role."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this project is to delineate the mechanism by which bile acids repress transcription of the human cholesterol 7-a hydroxylase (CYP7A1) gene. CYP7A1 catalyzes the initial, rate-limiting step of the classical pathway for bile acid biosynthesis and is a key enzyme in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. Bioactivity of CYP7A1 is regulated by feedback inhibition at the level of transcription by bile acids. It is known that bile acid-activated FXR activates transcription of SHP which in turn suppresses LRH-1 mediated transactivation of the CYP7A1 gene. Recent studies of SHP knock-out mice suggest that SHP independent pathways of bile acid repression exist as well. Although the master regulators and the bile acid response elements have been identified, the changes in response to bile acids in the regulatory protein complex and in the chromatin structure at the native human CYP7A1 promoter that lead to suppression of the gene in vivo are not known. In preliminary chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assays, we found that bile acid treatment resulted in decreased histone acetylation, and decreased association of coactivator histone acetyltransferases (HATs) p300 and CBP with the human CYP7A1 promoter. On the basis of these exciting results, we hypothesize that bile acids repress CYP7A1 transcription by modulating the association of HATs and histone deacetylases (HDACs) with the promoter resulting in chromatin structural changes which lead to repression of the CYP7A1 transcription. We propose to test this hypothesis using the ChIP assay to examine the association of proteins with the human CYP7A1 promoter in vivo and transcriptional assays in cell culture and in vivo to determine the functional significance of proteins shown to associate with the promoter. Specifically, we will examine the temporal effects of bile acid treatment at the human CYP7A1 promoter on: 1) endonuclease sensitivity of the nucleosomal structures, 2) histone acetylation and 3) the association of coactivators and corepressors. Experiments will be initiated to compare these changes related to chromatin structure with changes in the association of the nuclear receptors (LRH-1/HNF-4), chromatin remodeling complexes, and the RNA preinitiation complex. The effects of identified coactivators and corepressors on CYP7A1 transcription will be studied in cultured cells and in mouse hepatocytes in vivo using a tail vein injection method. Stably transfected HepG2 cells will be constructed for the study of the interaction of SHP with the promoter and for determination of whether overexpression of SHP in untreated cells can mediate all the effects of bile acid treatment. These studies should define the molecular changes that occur at the CYP7A1 promoter in vivo after bile acid treatment and provide new insight into the mechanism of repression of this gene, and possibly other genes, involved in cholesterol homeostasis."
"The overall goal of this project is to understand molecular mechanisms by which the nuclear bile acid receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), regulates metabolic homeostasis in normal and diseased states. The specific goal of this application is to elucidate the role of post-translational acetylation and deacetylation of FXR mediated by p300 and SIRT1 in FXR function in normal physiology and in pathological conditions. FXR playsa central role in cholesterol/bile acid, fatty acid, lipoprotein, and glucose metabolism by regulating expression of numerous its target genes. Although such important biological roles of FXR are now known, how FXR activity is regulated remains relatively unknown. Transcriptional cofactors, such as p300 acetylase and SIRT1 deacetylase, modulate receptor activity, not only by histone modification of their target gene chromatin, butalso by post-translational modification of the receptor itself. In preliminary studies, we found that FXR is acetylated and deacetylated by p300 and SIRT1, respectively. P300 and SIRT1 antagonize each other?s activity in the regulation of FXR transactivation. Down-regulation of p300 altered expression of FXR target genes, such that beneficial changes in lipid and glucose metabolic profiles would be expected. FXR acetylation was dynamically regulated under normal physiological states but surprisingly, FXR acetylation levels were substantially elevated in ob/ob mouse liver. Specific lysine residues in FXR were identified as acetylation sites by mass spectrometry and mutation analyses. Interestingly, mutation of these individual sites had different effects on FXR transactivation activity. These intriguing results led us to hypothesize first, thatacetylation profoundly modulates FXR activity and is dynamically regulated by p300 and SIRT1 under normal physiological conditions but is highly elevated under metabolic disease and stress conditions and second, that FXR acetylation at different sites may have distinct functional outcomes in normal and disease states by regulating different FXR target genes. To test our hypothesis, we will: 1) determine whether p300 and SIRT1 are critical in vivo cofactors of FXR by down-regulation of these cofactors in cultured cells and in vivo ; 2) identify acetylated sites in FXR and determine the effects of mutations of these sites on FXR function in vitro, in cultured cells, and in vivo; and 3) determine whether FXR acetylation is dysregulated in pathophysiological conditions and the role of acetylation at specific sites in the disease pathology. Our studies will providesubstantial insight into the molecular mechanism of FXR action in vivo and information that may be important for the development of novel therapeutic agents for metabolic disorders, such as fatty liver (liver steatosis), hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes.The bile acid receptor FXR has important biological roles in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis, triglyceride and lipoprotein metabolism, and glucose regulation in the liver, but how the activity of FXR is regulated remains largely unknown. Our studies to define how FXR acetylation controls FXR activity in health and disease states will provide important information about the mechanisms regulating levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoproteins, and glucose which are abnormal in diseases such as hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and diabetes. The studies may also facilitate the design of therapeutic agents for treating these metabolic disorders."
"Project SummaryThe overall goal of this application is to determine the interplay between the liver and intestine in the regulationof fed-state metabolism with emphasis on bile acid (BA) metabolism. BAs function as physiological detergentsto aid digestion of lipid nutrients but also function as signaling molecules that profoundly impact metabolism byactivating nuclear and membrane BA receptors and also by mediating induction of intestinal FGF15/19 (humanFGF19; mouse FGF15). BAs in excess are toxic so that their levels must be tightly controlled and the BAnuclear receptor FXR plays a key role in this regulation. Despite recent advances, the mechanisms underlyingthe interplay between the liver and intestine mediated by BAs and FGF15 to regulate BA levels, in particularhepatic expression of Cyp7a1, the rate-limiting BA synthetic enzyme, are not well understood. We havepreliminary evidence that FGF15-mediated phosphorylation by Src of FXR plays an important role in thisinterplay. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that Src phosphorylation of FXR at Tyr-67 ismediated by FGF15 signaling under physiological conditions and that Y67FXR phosphorylation isimportant for gene-selective transcriptional regulation to reduce liver BA levels and terminate FGF15signaling. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Examine the in vivo role of Srcphosphorylation of FXR in regulating BA levels, protecting against hepatobiliary defects in normal mice and inmice challenged with biliary insults, and human relevance by examining FXR and Src and their phosphorylatedforms in liver samples from primary cholestasis patients. 2) Define the function and mechanisms of FXRphosphorylation by FGF15- and BA-activated Src in the regulation of BA metabolism and 3) determine the roleof FGF15-mediated phosphorylation of FXR, in coordination with PPAR?, in terminating FGF15 signaling.Multiple in vitro and in vivo approaches will be used, including genetic and virally generated mouse models andChIP-seq genomic analysis to identify FXR binding sites globally in mice treated with FGF19. Our expertise onpost-translational modifications of nuclear receptors and transcriptional regulation of BA metabolism uniquelyqualifies us to address this important research question of the role of posttranslational phosphorylation of FXRin regulation of BA metabolism. Our proposal will determine the novel function and mechanisms of FGF15-induced phosphorylation of FXR, and provide new potential therapeutics and diagnostic markers for BA- andFGF15-related diseases, including cholestatic liver diseases."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to determine whether the nuclear bile acid receptor, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR), functions as a master metabolic regulator by coordinating the responses of the liver and intestine to bile acid signalingin vivo. Bile acids are important integrative signaling molecules that control metabolism and energy balance and FXR, as the primary biosensor for bile acids, plays an important role in controlling bile acid, cholesterol, and glucose levels through regulation of gene expression. Aftera meal, bile acid-activated FXR induces the synthesis and secretion of a recently identified intestinal hormone, fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), which acts at the liver to control fed-state metabolism. Beta-Klotho (bKL) is the membrane coreceptor for FGF19 and, thus, is crucial for the FGF19 signaling in the liver. Our recent genome-wide hepatic FXR binding and microRNA (miR) studies have suggested that FXR may regulate hepatic expression of FGF19 signaling pathway genes, particularly bKL, both by induction of gene expression and post-transcriptionally through the inhibition of miR-34a. In FXR null mice, the mRNA and protein levels of bKL were substantially decreased, whereas miR-34a levels were increased. Moreover, miR-34a likely targets bKL by directly binding to the 3'UTR of the bKL mRNA. Remarkably, hepatic bKL levels were substantially reduced, miR-34a levels were elevated, and FGF19-activated ERK signaling was defective in obese mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that FXR primes the liver for signaling by intestinal FGF19 both by transcriptionally regulating expression of key components of the FGF19 pathway, particularly bKL, and by post-transcriptionally up-regulating bKL indirectly through miR-34a inhibition. Further, an aberrant FXR/miR-34a/bKL regulatory axis in obesity contributes to defective FGF19 signaling and abnormal metabolic responses. To test these hypotheses, we will employ multiple approaches from in vitro and cell culture, including primary hepatocytes, studies to in vivo studies using normal, obese, and FXR-null mice. We will first ask whether FXR transcriptionally regulates hepatic expression of key components of FGF19 signaling, particularly bKL, and therefore, primes the liver to respond to FGF19 signaling. Second we will ask whether miR-34a, known to be negatively regulated by FXR, directly targets and regulates the levels of bKL. We will also examine whether this FXR/miR-34a/bKL regulatory pathway is abnormal in obese mice, and, if so, whether targeting components of this pathway, particularly the aberrantly elevated miR-34, might be useful in the treatment of metabolic disease. Our proposed studies should provide new insights into the mechanisms by which FXR coordinates gut-liver bile acid signaling and may reveal novel therapeutic targets to treat metabolic disorders."

"DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): One of the challenges facing researchers working on oxygen-regulated biological phenomenon, as well as medical practitioners attempting to minimize hypoxia-induced tissue damage, is gaining a fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms for gauging oxygen availability. In spite of significant progress in our understanding of the physiological response to hypoxia, the molecular components involved in sensing oxygen and the pathways for transducing this information are poorly understood. The long-term objective of our research is to delineate oxygen-sensing mechanisms and the signaling pathways involved in eliciting adaptive responses at the level of gene expression. In this revised proposal, we focus on determining the role that cytochrome c oxidase, and possibly other components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, plays in oxygen-sensing pathways. A yeast model will be used to address the following specific aims. Aim 1: Identify the cis site(s) in the promoters of oxygen-responsive genes that confer(s) sensitivity to inhibitors and mutations in the respiratory chain. To address this aim, the promoter regions of several oxygen-responsive genes will be fused to the reporter gene LacZ and used to define the minimal-sized DNA fragment and essential nucleotides that confer sensitivity to inhibitors and mutations in the respiratory chain. Aim 2: Identify trans-acting factors that interact with these cis sites and other proteins involved in transducing the low oxygen signal from the mitochondrion to the nucleus. Once the cis site is defined, one-hybrid and two-hybrid screens will be used to identify the trans-acting factor(s) and other proteins responsible for mediating sensitivity to inhibitors and mutations in the respiratory chain. In addition, genome-wide transcript profiling analyses will be used to identify additional sensory and signaling proteins. These studies can be expected to provide novel findings and new insight into the crosstalk between the mitochondrion and nucleus that is involved in modulating the expression of oxygen-responsive genes and provide a general model of oxygen sensing in eukaryotic cells."

"? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contact pathway of blood clotting contributes to thrombotic diseases but either has no impact on hemostasis or is associated with relatively mild bleeding diatheses in man. Furthermore, the contact pathway contributes to inflammation, kinin generation, and complement, placing it at the nexus of thrombotic and inflammatory pathways. This raises the possibility that interrupting the contact pathway might be strongly antithrombotic/anti-inflammatory with fewer bleeding side effects compared to anticoagulants that target the common pathway of clotting. Work from our lab has shown that inorganic polyphosphate, which is secreted by activated platelets and which is present in infectious microorganisms, is highly procoagulant and is likely one of the long-sought pathophysiologic activators of the contact pathway. Subsequent work from our lab and others has now demonstrated polyphosphate to be an important link between hemostasis and inflammation/innate immunity. In the present grant period, we have further increased the knowledge of how polyphosphate regulates the blood clotting system. In particular, we showed that polyphosphate is a highly active cofactor for factor XI function, which may explain its otherwise puzzling contribution to hemostasis. We identified a series of new polyphosphate inhibitors that protect against thrombosis in vivo, and we also showed that polyphosphate modulates the complement cascade. This growing body of work demonstrates polyphosphate to be a regulatory molecule at the nexus of hemostasis, thrombosis and inflammation/innate immunity. Although much has been learned about the contributions of polyphosphate to these processes, much remains to be understood, and this is the focus of this renewal application. In the current application, we will address three specific aims focusing on: (1) Understanding how polyphosphate's procoagulant activities are regulated by metal ions, comparing the relative procoagulant activities of polyphosphate and extracellular nucleic acids, and understanding how polyphosphate and extracellular histones work together to activate clotting; (2) Understanding the mechanism(s) that control decay of polyphosphate in blood; and (3) Developing effective, highly biocompatible polyphosphate inhibitors as novel, safe antithrombotic agents."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent in vivo studies from several laboratories have challenged the paradigm that tissue factor is solely responsible for triggering blood clotting in thrombotic disease, by showing that blocking the function of coagulation factor XII (which is essential for the contact pathway of blood clotting) significantly decreases thrombosis in animal models. However, for many years it has been unclear how the contact pathway is initiated in vivo. Recent work from our laboratory has identified inorganic polyphosphate as the long-sought (patho) physiologic activator of the contact pathway. Polyphosphate is secreted from activated platelets and accumulates in infectious microorganisms; we propose that it is an important triggering agent at the nexus of prothrombotic and pro-inflammatory pathways. Our studies have now shown that, in addition to being an extremely potent initiator of the contact pathway, polyphosphate also accelerates factor V activation and enhances fibrin clot structure, leading to thicker fibrin fibrils that are more resistant to fibrinolysis. Because the ability of polyphosphate to modulate blood clotting has only recently been discovered, we still do not understand mechanistically how polyphosphate exerts its effects on coagulation. Similarly, many questions remain regarding where, when and how if functions in vivo. These questions will be addressed in three aims, which focus on: understanding how polyphosphate triggers the contact pathway of clotting; understanding how polyphosphate accelerates factor V activation; and understanding how polyphosphate functions in vivo. The work outlined in this grant proposal will therefore provide a mechanistic understanding of how polyphosphate functions in hemostasis, thrombosis and inflammation. These studies are designed to identify novel drug targets for interrupting thrombotic and inflammatory pathways with minimized risk of bleeding side effects. They are also designed to develop novel hemostatic agents for treating bleeding."

"The theme of this project is to understand how complexes of proteins within the blood clotting cascadeassemble on membrane surfaces and how this assembly process regulates enzymatic activity. Theproposed studies focus on assembly of the cell-surface complex that triggers blood clotting, consisting ofthe regulatory protein, tissue factor, and its cognate serine protease, factor Vila; and investigating themechanism of action of novel regulators of blood clotting that we have recently discovered. Specifically, wewill investigate the following research questions: (1) How does membrane topography contribute to tissuefactor function? These studies will examine the consequences of altering the membrane topography oftissue factor on the proteolytic activity of the tissue factor-factor Vila complex. Included is an investigationof a novel way of attaching the extracellular domain of tissue factor (sTF) to membrane surfaces employingoligohistidine-tagged sTF and metal ion-chelating lipids. (2) How does polyphosphate modulate the bloodclotting cascade? We discovered that polyphosphate, an ancient molecule that is abundant in many microorganisms, and newly discovered in dense granules of human platelets, is a potent modulator of bloodclotting and fibrinolysis. We will examine: (a) platelet secretion of polyphosphate, including studies comparing normal platelets and platelets from patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome; (b) the ability ofpolyphosphate to stimulate the contact pathway of blood clotting; (c) the mechanism by which polyphosphate completely abrogates the anticoagulant function of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI); (d) how polyphosphate modulates thrombin function; and (e) how expression of polyphosphate in bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) modulates the blood clotting and fibrinolytic cascades. These studies are aimed at understanding how newly discovered modulators of the blood clotting system contribute to normal hemostasis and to the activation of the blood clotting system in human disease."

The proposed studies focus on assembly of the cell-surface complex that triggers blood clotting, consisting of the regulatory protein, tissue factor, and its cognate serine protease, factor Vila; and investigating the mechanism of action of novel regulators of blood clotting that we have recently discovered. Specifically, we will investigate the following research questions: (1) How does membrane topography contribute to tissue factor function? These studies will examine the consequences of altering the membrane topography of tissue factor on the proteolytic activity of the tissue factor-factor Vila complex. Included is an investigation of a novel way of attaching the extracellular domain of tissue factor (sTF) to membrane surfaces employing oligohistidine-tagged sTF and metal ion-chelating lipids. (2) How does polyphosphate modulate the blood clotting cascade? We discovered that polyphosphate, an ancient molecule that is abundant in many microorganisms, and newly discovered in dense granules of human platelets, is a potent modulator of blood clotting and fibrinolysis. We will examine: (a) platelet secretion of polyphosphate, including studies comparing normal platelets and platelets from patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome; (b) the ability of polyphosphate to stimulate the contact pathway of blood clotting; (c) the mechanism by which polyphosphate completely abrogates the anticoagulant function of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI); (d) how polyphosphate modulates thrombin function; and (e) how expression of polyphosphate in bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) modulates the blood clotting and fibrinolytic cascades. These studies are aimed at understanding how newly discovered modulators of the blood clotting system contribute to normal hemostasis and to the activation of the blood clotting system in human disease."
"DESCRIPTION: (Investigator's abstract) The event that triggers the blood clotting system in thrombotic disease and normal hemostasis is the assembly of the cell surface complex of tissue factor (an integral membrane protein) and factor VIIa (a plasma serine protease). The resulting tissue factor-factor VIIa-phospholipid complex activates factors IX and X by limited proteolysis. The long-term goals of these studies are to understand how the this two-subunit enzyme assembles on membrane surfaces, how tissue factor allosterically activates factor VIIa, and how the membrane participates in catalysis. This proposal will address the following three questions. (1) What governs the topography of the tissue factor-factor VIIa-phospholipid complex? Tissue factor not only allosterically activates factor VIIa, but is also thought to position and orient factor VIIa's active site (relative to the membrane surface) for optimum attack on the scissile bonds of membrane-bound substrates. How it does this is not well understood. This project will employ a number of approaches to understanding how the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex assembles and functions on membrane surfaces. (2) How does the putative macromolecular substrate-binding site on tissue factor contribute to catalysis? A region on tissue factor has been proposed to contribute to catalysis by providing an additional binding/recognition site for macromolecular substrates. This will be studied in detail in this proposal. (3) How do zinc ions inhibit factor VIIa? Zinc ions may be a physiological regulator of factor VIIa function, but the binding site on factor VIIa for zinc is not known, nor is its mechanism of action. This project will study the mechanism of action of zinc and determine the location of the zinc binding site on factor VIIa. These studies are designed to provide new insights in the process by which the blood clotting system is triggered in thrombotic disease, the major cause of disability and death in the United States."
"DESCRIPTION (Investigator's Abstract): Tissue factor, a protein found on the surfaces of certain cell types, is the primary triggering agent of blood clotting. Its ligand, factor VII/VIIa, is a serine protease that can exist as an inert zymogen (factor VII) or active enzyme (factor VIIa), both of which circulate in the plasma. Assembly of tissue factor/factor VIIa complexes on cell surfaces is a critical step in controlling the clotting cascade both in hemostasis and in thrombosis. Thrombotic diseases (heart attack, thrombotic stroke, and so forth) constitute the major cause of premature death and disability in the United States and other industrialized countries. Accordingly, a long-term goal of this laboratory is to understand how the tissue factor/factor VIIa system functions and how it is regulated. This project focuses on how tissue factor allosterically activates factor VIIa and positions it for optimal attack on membrane-bound protein substrates. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) Elucidate the role of substrate binding site(s) on tissue factor in recognition of macromolecular substrates; (2) Investigate the role of the 4-carboxyglutamate-rich domains of factors VII, IX, and X in the activity of the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex; (3) Investigate the function of membrane- interactive regions of tissue factor and map the topography of the tissue factor-factor VIIa-phospholipid complex; and (4) Probe the molecular basis for substrate and inhibitor specificity of factor VIIa. These studies will employ site-directed mutagenesis and domain-swapping approaches, and will analyze the functional consequences of these alterations using enzyme kinetics and measurements of protein-protein and protein-phospholipid interactions. Achieving the goals of this project will provide detailed knowledge of the assembly and function of critical components of the initiator complex of blood coagulation. Such knowledge will ultimately be useful in designing and applying novel antithrombotic agents targeted at the initiation phase of the clotting system."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Almost every step in blood coagulation requires assembly of multiple proteins on membrane surfaces, yet protein-membrane interactions in blood clotting remain poorly understood at the molecular level. We are using new, high-resolution technologies including magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR (SSNMR) to probe the mechanisms by which blood clotting proteins interact with phospholipid surfaces, and how changes in membrane composition regulate clotting reactions. The primary focus of our studies is the membrane-bound complex of tissue factor and factor VIIa, the two-subunit enzyme responsible for triggering blood clotting in health and disease. Aim 1 will delineate, at atomic resolution, the changes in structure and dynamics of PS- rich membrane domains in the presence of Ca2+, and will examine the roles of phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in configuring the membrane to support high affinity binding of clotting factors. Aim 2 will investigate the role of phospholipid-phospholipid interactions in enhancing blood clotting reactions on membrane surfaces. Aim 3 will delineate the lipid environments/conformations induced when clotting proteins bind to bilayers. Aim 4 will solve the structure of tissue factor on the membrane surface and identify conformational changes in tissue factor when it interacts with ligands. Together these studies will provide valuable new insights into the role of the membrane surface in blood clotting, at atomic-scale resolution. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disorders of the blood clotting system represent the leading cause of disability and death in the United States, but we still have a very incomplete understanding of blood clotting reactions at the molecular level. These studies will shed new light on the regulation of the blood clotting system, with a particular focus on achieving a detailed understanding of how and why blood clotting reactions occur on membrane surfaces."

"AbstractThe overall vision is to create a detailed understanding of mechanisms that regulate the blood clotting system,with a goal of elucidating the aspects of the clotting machinery that function differentially in hemostasis versusthrombosis. The conceptual framework is that human thrombotic diseases result from an otherwise protectivemechanism (immunothrombosis) gone awry. In this view, hemostasis following vascular injury is driven by theprompt exposure of blood to preexisting, natural procoagulants such as tissue factor and collagen that areubiquitous throughout the body and that induce rapid formation of hemostatic plugs. On the other hand,immunothrombosis is likely triggered and/or greatly enhanced by the elaboration of damage-associatedmolecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associate molecular patterns (PAMPs). An important concept isthat many of these PAMPs and DAMPs that drive immunothrombosis are potential therapeutic targets thatshould have little or no involvement in normal hemostasis. In order to achieve this vision, we need to have amuch better mechanistic understanding of what regulates blood clotting reactions, and in particular we need toidentify and understand the DAMPs that drive thrombosis and coagulopathies. The proposed work will focus onthree general areas within this general conceptual framework: elucidating mechanisms by which procoagulantanionic polymers such as polyphosphate (polyP) and nucleic acids trigger regulate blood clotting andinflammation; identifying key structural details that control the function of the tissue factor/factor VIIa complex;and achieving a detailed understanding of how phospholipid bilayers regulate blood clotting reactions. Thesestudies will build on our prior success in this area and will advance the field."
"The objective of the established training Program is to train biologist engineers, physicists, and veterinary medicine specialists in one or more of the oncology-related areas of expertise by a diverse and interdisciplinary, but cooperating faculty and serves as a central focus for training predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees for careers in the interdisciplinary fields related to the identification, classification and treatment of cancer on the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) campus. The Program is designed to produce individuals whose breadth and depth of training will enable them to function in a variety of institutions and to have productive careers in the various interdisciplinary areas of biophysics and bioengineering in radiation oncology. The program is unique in that it seeks to (1) attract students particularly from physical science or engineering departments to cancer- related research; (2) provide training in cancer-related topics not generally offered in departmental programs and (3) promote interdisciplinary (and interdepartmental) interactions and research opportunities. This training Program has, in fact, been the impetus for an increased profile on the University of Illinois campus where it has provided the mechanism to fund predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees to conduct more directed cancer research that would have otherwise been possible. The 16 Program faculty are drawn from 7 academic departments in 3 colleges as well as the Carle Cancer Center, but the research activities focus on 4 identifiable areas: bioacoustics, including ultrasound (US) instrumentation, US-tissue interaction mechanisms, and US-and microwave-hyperthermia; imaging, including US and magnetic resonance (MR), as well as nuclear medicine, molecular probes and tumor image agents; spectroscopy, including ESR, EPR and MR; and radiation biophysics, including free radical studies, repair mechanisms, longevity effects, and interactions with hyperthermia. We propose a program of 3 postdoctoral trainees and 7 predoctorals. This represents no increase from the current Program period."
"The objective of this two-year initiative is to develop the basis for a fundamentally new technology for an in situ clinical diagnosis of solid tumors with the expectation of rapid and accurate detection and diagnosis of cancer. The research approach is interdisciplinary (acoustic and electrical engineers, image and signal processor, material scientists, and board-certified veterinary pathologist). Given the important in patient health-care management of obtaining a highly accurate and timely diagnosis of a tumor and the difficulties, processing time, and risks associated with surgical and aspirational biopsies, a technique which would permit the evaluation of tumors in situ would be enormously beneficial medically and cost effective. The specific aims of this two-year initiative are: (1) to identify ultrasonic image features of tissues and cells that differentiate cytoarchitectural features of normal tissues from selected neoplastic tissues using well-established non-invasive pulse-echo data acquisition schemes and high-definition image formation techniques applicable for the invasive in vivo ultrasonic microprobe geometry, (3) to construct and evaluate invasive in vivo ultrasonic microprobes using two separate construction approaches, and (4) to identify ultrasonic image features of tissues and cells that differentiate cytoarchitectural features of normal tissues from selected neoplastic tissues using the invasive in vivo ultrasonic microprobes. Light microscopic histopathologic evaluation of the identical tissues by a board-certified veterinary pathologist will be used as the gold standard. Three categories of ultrasonic data acquisition are proposed, viz., non- invasive using commercial transducers; invasive microprobe using existing, commercially available materials; and invasive microprobe using newly developed materials. Conventional B-mode and C-mode imaging techniques will be investigated. In addition, it is proposed to adapt signal processing techniques from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging techniques. Also, image formation and enhancement methods will be tested and verified on stimulate data based on a full-fledged statistical model of the ultrasound imaging processing, adopting an enhanced version of the standard fully-developed-speckle model."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of the proposed partnership is to develop, unify, refine and implement a new approach to quantitative ultrasound (QUS) imaging of biological tissues and mammary tumors by the quantification of tissue microstructure. In lay terms, if the research is successful, many breast abnormalities and lesions can be diagnosed without the need for a biopsy. The overall hypothesis of our partnership is that a set of QUS parameters can significantly improve breast lesion differentiation/classification. The primary QUS parameters to be exploited include attenuation, scatterer size, scatterer number density, and acoustic concentration (scatterer number density times their impedance change). Our goal in the first 5 years of this project is to lay the foundation for a new (possibly revolutionary but definitely evolutionary) diagnostic imaging capability through development, testing, and verification with simulations, phantoms, and in vitro and in vivo animal model experiments, as well as preliminary human subjecting testing. In the second 5 years we will extend the analysis beyond common breast lesions, begin Phase II clinical trials and work towards the creation of automated tools to assist in the diagnosis of breast abnormalities. The partnership is between engineers, acoustic physicists, statisticians and veterinary pathologists at UIUC and physicists, engineers, pathologists and radiologists at UW. The PI is William D. O'Brien, Jr. (UIUC), and functioning as the co-Pi is Timothy J. Hall (UW). Use of QUS imaging is medically significant because it offers a potentially real-time and noninvasive means of differentiation/classification tumor types and tracking their response to therapy. To this end, 5 specific aims are proposed, viz., 1) unify QUS algorithms with simulations, phantoms and animal tumor models in vivo, 2) associate acoustic microstructural measurements with anatomical scattering sources, 3) monitor the changes in QUS parameters with tumor growth in in vivo animal models, 4) compare tumors in human subjects with those in animal models, and 5) develop a major outreach activity."
"The proposed research program is a basic science (non-clinical) investigation of a potentially significant ultrasound (US)-induced biological effect, that is, whether the application of ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) in humans adversely affects the vasculature. The medical profession benefits from these studies if it is shown that diagnostic US is a significant medical risk to the patient by advising clinicians about this risk, and by suggesting how the clinician can monitor the degree of risk. Likewise, the medical profession benefits from these studies if it is shown that diagnostic US is not a significant medical risk to the patient by eliminating vascular injury as a clinical concern. In either case, there is clear medical significance. The data necessary to decide this issue are not currently available. Today, we are faced with a significant challenge about the use of UCAs in humans, that is, the lack of knowledge as to whether the interaction of US with UCAs is a significant medical problem in humans. The FDA is also uncertain about UCAs' safety and/or effectiveness and is waiting until more is known about the risk of these agents before approving new UCAs, thus denying their well-known benefits to the patient. Studies have been designed to address directly this 'safe-use' issue by an interdisciplinary group of investigators who have considerable experience with US-induced tissue damage studies, as well as considerable experimental and theoretical experience with US biophysics and related physics areas. Using our continued proactive approach, we propose to utilize our extensive US bioeffects/biophysics expertise, along with our pathological, nutritional, biostatistical modeling and animal model expertise, to determine whether the interaction of US with UCAs is a significant medical problem in humans. The experimental (animal-based) and theoretical (mechanism-development) research program has four specific aims, viz., 1) to determine the US thresholds for arterial damage in normal, healthy New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits when US interacts with UCAs in vivo; 2) to determine the US thresholds for arterial damage in post-exposure atherogenic diet-fed NZW rabbits when US interacts with UCAs in vivo; 3) to determine the US thresholds for arterial damage in pre-exposure atherogenic diet-fed NZW rabbits when US interacts with UCAs in vivo; and 4) to determine UCA thresholds in vitro. We are proposing 7 in vivo studies and a set of in vitro studies to accomplish our experimental and theoretical objectives."

"DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): The proposed research program is a basic science (non-clinical) evaluation of a known ultrasound-induced biological effect, the goal of which is to determine the current and future role of diagnostic ultrasound relative to this biological effect. The medical profession benefits if it is shown that diagnostic ultrasound is a significant medical risk to the patient by advising clinicians about this risk, and suggesting how the clinician can monitor the degree of risk. Likewise, the medical profession benefits if it is shown that diagnostic ultrasound is not a significant medical risk to the patient by eliminating this as a clinical concern. In either case, there is clear medical significance. The data necessary to decide this issue are not currently available. The current status regarding ultrasound-induced lung damage in experimental animals supports the view that diagnostic ultrasound equipment poses a risk to human beings. The proposed studies have been designed to address directly these issues by an interdisciplinary group of investigators who have considerable experimental experience with ultrasound-induced lung damage, lung morphology and lung function research studies, and in addition considerable experimental and theoretical experience with ultrasound biophysics and related physics areas. The experimental (animal-based) and theoretical (mechanism-development) research program has four specific aims, viz., (1) to evaluate ultrasound levels at which minimum detectable lung hemorrhage occurs as a function of species and age; (2) to evaluate the physiological ramifications and function, (3) to evaluate the damage mechanism experimentally; and (4) to develop a theory that addresses one general class of damage mechanisms. The experimental design investigates ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage as a function of both age and species, and the design of the experimental variables all aim at providing a database that can be used to extrapolate the findings to human beings. The theoretical studies provide a mathematical basis for understanding the basic mechanism so that another approach is available for extrapolating to humans."
"DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): The amended, proposed research program is a basic science (non-clinical) evaluation of a significant ultrasound-induced biological effect which is intended to determine the current and future role of diagnostic ultrasound technology. The medical profession benefits if it can be shown that diagnostic ultrasound is a significant medical risk to the patient by advising clinicians about this risk, and suggesting how (through a possibly modified Mechanical Index) the clinician can monitor the degree of risk. Likewise, medical profession benefits if it is show that diagnostic ultrasound is not a significant medical risk to the patient by eliminating this as a clinical concern. In either case, there is clear medical significance. The data necessary to decide this issue is not currently available, but the current status regarding ultrasound-induced lung damage in experimental animals supports the view that diagnostic ultrasound equipment can damage human lungs. Most mammalian lungs, functionally are very similar and therefore, it is likely that lung damage and hemorrhage associated with ultrasound is related to structural differences that exists between species. Critical structural features of the lung that can be used to separate species into distinct groups are pleural thickness (thin verses thick), pleural blood supply (pulmonary artery verses bronchial artery), septal or interlobular connective tissue (scant verses abundant), and relative thickness of the chest wall (thin or thick [relative amounts of skin, muscle, fat, connective tissue]). On the basis of these comparisons, human beings can be clearly grouped with pigs (the 'thick' group) and therefore, pigs will represent the animal model for understanding the pathogenesis of ultrasound-induced lung damage and hemorrhage in human beings. In addition, when these same comparisons are made between the 'thick' group which contains human beings and pigs, and the 'thin' group, it is clearly demonstrated that rats and rabbits are in the 'thin' group. This latter group serves as a critical structural biologic control group to test the hypothesis that structural differences are truly the critical components that provide human beings with ample protection from any harmful bioeffects associated with ultrasound. The experimental (animal-based) research program has the four specific aims, viz. (1) to evaluate ultrasound levels at which minimum detectable lung hemorrhage occurs as a function of species, (2) and of age, (3) to evaluate functional alterations from ultrasound induced-lung hemorrhage at superthreshold conditions, and (4) to evaluate the damage mechanism of ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Funds are requested via the S10 NIH funding mechanism to purchase a VisualSonics Vevo 2100 high-resolution small-animal ultrasound imaging system to be shared by 10 major projects (representing 6 investigators who have 12 NIH-funded grants) and 6 minor projects. Each of the 16 projects will yield value-added benefits from the use of the Vevo 2100. Such a shared capability does not exist at the University of Illinois although many of the seminal ultrasound imaging discoveries can be traced to the more than 60 years of basic science ultrasound research at the University of Illinois. However, as the University investigators transition their research closer to direct clinical activities, high- frequency ultrasound imaging (qualitative and quantitative) of small animals under efficient high- throughput and longitudinal study conditions require the type of system being requested. Our proposal outlines the (1) scientific need; (2) technical support, administration, oversight; (3) representative investigator research applications; (4) institutional commitment; and (5) academic community benefit of our proposed VisualSonics Vevo 2100 system.

"DESCRIPTION: (Scanned from the applicant's abstract) In stably transfected ER+ HeLa-ER cells, we find that 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT)-ER and l7b-estradiol (E2)-ER, elicit an extremely rapid activation of the p38 and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. Activation of p38 or iNK by OHT-ER or E2-ER is strongly correlated with the induction of apoptosis. In MCF-7 cells, OHT, but not E2, induces p38 and apoptosis and a p38 inhibitor blocks induction of p38 and apoptosis. Activation of p38 and induction of' apoptosis represent newly identified actions of estrogen receptor. The Specific Aims are: (1) To identify the pathway leading from OHT-ER (and En-ER) to the phosphorylation and activation of p38 and JNK. OHT-ER induces phosphorylation of p38 and JNK in 2 min. suggesting a nongenomic effect. (a) We will identify the ER domains (such as nuclear localization) required for OHT-ER activation of p38 and JNK; (b) evaluate the possible role in p38 activation of a membrane-associated ER using cells enriched in a putative membrane ER. by specifically targeting ER to cell membranes, and through studies of potential ER-caveolae interactions: (c) use dominant negative MKKs to determine the role of MKKs in phosphorylating p38 and JNK in response to OHT-ER and E2-ER. (2) To investigate the relationship between the activation of p38 by OHT-ER and by E2-ER and the induction of apoptosis. We will determine the kinetics of the second late stage of activation of p38 and JNK seen in our preliminary studies, determine whether apoptosis requires the late activation of p38 and JNK, and whether the late activation is genomic or non-genomic. We propose a novel, testable, hypothesis relevant to both breast cancer chemoprevention and therapy by tamoxifen (Tam), and perhaps by other SERMs. In mammary epithelial cells, the level of activation of cell death pathways produced by the DNA damage often responsible for transformation may sometimes be insufficient to induce apoptosis of all damaged cells. In cells with low levels of ER, the additional weak induction of p38 and JNK by OHT-ER potentiates apoptosis induced by DNA damage, and thereby stimulates apoptosis of pre-malignant and early stage breast cancer cells. (3) We will slightly damage the DNA of mammary epithelial cells and ER+ cell lines with a low level of UV light and determine whether Tam activates p38 or JNK and potentiates apoptosis of the cells. (4) To determine whether the progression of breast cancer cell lines to Tam resistance involves loss of Tam induction of p38 or JNK, or loss of ability of p38 or JNK to induce apoptosis, we will use existing Tam resistant breast cancer cell lines and cell lines we isolate, inhibitors and dominate negative mutants. These studies help define a new pathway for ER action and test a novel hypothesis for how SERMs function."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a novel approach to identifying new probes and potential anticancer agents based on reducing expression of c-Myc and other oncogenes, MDR1 (multidrug resistance protein 1) and NF-?B by targeting the mRNA binding protein IMP-1/CRD-BP/IGF2BP1. IMP-1 is an oncofetal mRNA binding protein that binds to and stabilizes the mRNAs encoding c-Myc, K-Ras, ERK and other oncogenes, MDR1, and indirectly increases activity of the tumor enabling factor NF-?B. ?-catenin and c-Myc induce IMP-1 and it is a key regulatory target of let-7 microRNA. Reducing IMP-1 levels by RNAi knockdown, or by expression of let-7 miRNA, reduces c- Myc levels, strongly inhibits cell proliferation and reverses resistance to anticancer drugs. Kaplan-Meier plots show that expression of IMP-1 is associated with a poor prognosis and reduced survival in lung, ovarian and colon cancer. Small molecule inhibitors of IMP-1 have not been reported. In preliminary studies, we identified an IMP-1 binding and mRNA stabilizing site in MDR1 mRNA, established a (FAMA) fluorescence anisotropy/polarization microplate assay for analyzing binding of IMP-1 to its c-Myc and MDR1 mRNA targets, developed a robust (Z' factor=0.64) FAMA-based high throughput screen for inhibitors of binding of IMP-1 to a c-Myc mRNA binding site and carried out a successful pilot screen. To filter the primary hits, we established verification assays based on purified protein, luciferase reporters and cell-proliferation. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. To identify small molecules with high potency and specificity that inhibit binding of IMP-1 to its c-Myc mRNA binding site. We will implement a FAMA HTS screen using ~180,000 small molecules and identify compounds that inhibit binding of purified IMP-1 to a fluorescein-labeled (fl) c-Myc mRNA binding site. To reduce the number of false positives, our two-step assay first uses an internal counterscreen to test whether each compound reduces the signal from the fl-Myc probe alone and then tests whether the compound inhibits binding of IMP-1 to the fl-Myc probe. (i) Primary hits will be simultaneously verified using fl-Myc and tested for ability to inhibit bindingof IMP-1 to the fl-MDR1 mRNA binding site (ii) To test for specificity, we will evaluate hits for inhibition of binding of progesterone receptor (PR) to its fl-DNA response element (fl-PRE). (iii) Potency and efficacy of hits will be evaluated in dose-response studies. Aim 2. To identify lead IMP-1 inhibitors which reduce the growth of cancer cells. Initial cell-based assays are luciferase-based assays for small molecules that inhibit expression of NF-?B-luciferase and our luciferase- MDR1 mRNA chimera and for inhibition of proliferation of IMP-1 positive IGROV-1 and ES-2 ovarian cancer cells with little or no effect on IMP-1 negative PC-3 cells. To approach inhibitor sites of action, lead compounds will be tested for down-regulation of IMP-1 protein and c-Myc and MDR1 mRNA and protein. Microarray studies using IMP-1 negative cells will assess possible off-target effects of the lead inhibitor. Lead structures will be confirmed, leads resynthesized and structural studies of inhibitor bound to IMP-1 will be initiated."
"Using vitellogenin mRNA stabilization as a model, we are investigating the posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA stability by estrogen. This proposal focuses on our identification and cloning of vigilin as the estrogen-inducible protein which binds to a segment of the vitellogenin mRNA 3'- untranslated region important in estrogen-mediated stabilization. This intriguing, but largely unstudied, protein is conserved in all eukaryotic cells, and contains 14 distinct RNA binding domains. Vigilin forms a multi-component estrogen-regulated complex by binding to specific mRNAs, tRNA and elongation factor lalpha(EF lalpha). The Specific Aims are: (1) To test the hypothesis that vigilin controls mRNA degradation by functioning as an integrator protein, forming a multi-component complex which links the effects of estrogen and other specific hormone signals with sensing of the overall rate of cell protein synthesis. To identify additional vigilin interaction partners we will use yeast 2-hybrid analysis, and RNA gel shifts assays. We will prepare targeted disruptions of the vigilin gene in DT40 cells and use these cells, pull-down experiments RNA gel shift assays and mammalian 2-hybrid studies carry out physical and functional mapping of the vigilin-mRNA-tRNA-EF lalpha complex. We will determine whether vigilin s interactions with tRNA and EF lalpha alter its affinity for specific mRNAs. To analyze the functional importance of vigilin-mRNA-tRNA-EF lalpha-interactions in the control of mRNA stability, we will carry out transfections in the vigilin cell line and analyze the effects of different vigilin levels and of different mRNA translation rates on mRNA degradation. We will regulate translation rates and vigilin levels in the reticulocyte lysate protein-synthesizing system and examine the degradation of mRNA targets by the polysomal mRNA endonuclease, PMR-1. (2) To investigate how estrogen and changes in cell growth and protein production induce vigilin, we will clone and analyze the vigilin promoter and analyze the regulation of vigilin transcription by estrogen and by growth factors. We will evaluate the potential role of autoregulation by free vigilin in control of vigilin levels. (3) To evaluate the role of the PMR-1 mRNase in vitellogenin mRNA degradation, we will identify the initial vitellogenin mRNA cleavage site and analyze the effect of PMR-1 on vigilin-controlled mRNA degradation in cell-free systems and in the vigilin cell line. These studies should provide new insights into a novel link between estrogen receptor action, protein synthesis rates, and the regulation of mRNA degradation."
"Estrogens, acting via estrogen receptor α (ERα), were known to regulate gene expression and to activatesignal transduction pathways. We identified a conserved extranuclear pathway by which 17β-estradiol (E2),acting through ERα, rapidly activates phosphoplipase C γ (PLCγ) leading to production of inositol triphosphate(IP3). The IP3 binds to and opens endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) IP3 receptors (IP3R) leading to extremely rapid(&lt;1 min.) efflux of calcium (Ca2+) from the lumen of the EnR into the cell body. Elevated intracellular Ca2+primes cells for subsequent actions of E2-ERα; depletion of EnR Ca2+ activates the unfolded protein response(UPR), inducing the important chaperone BiP/GRP78 (glucose regulated protein 78 kDa). Activation of thispathway is required for E2-ERα-regulated gene expression, induction of cell proliferation and protects cellsagainst stress. We target this pathway with our medically promising ERα biomodulator, BHPI, which uses thesame pathway as E2, but induces toxic hyperactivation of the UPR. Our hypothesis is that the products ofactivation of this newly unveiled pathway, elevated intracellular calcium (Aim 1), and at later times, BiPchaperone (Aim 2), link to and regulate subsequent E2-ERα-regulated gene expression and stabilize ERα,influencing drug resistance and genomic actions of ERα. Our goals are to identify the mechanism(s) by whichthese products couple to, and control, gene expression (Aim 1), ERα stability and response to drugs (Aim 2),and to identify the sensors and signals that allow E2-ERα to rapidly initiate the pathway (Aim 3). Aim 1.Identify the mechanism(s) by which the product of E2-ERα activation of the pathway couples to andcontrols E2-ERα-regulated gene expression. Test the data-driven hypothesis that Ca2+ produced bypathway activation acts through the Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM) to regulate nuclear E2-ERα:CaMinteraction, E2-ERα dimerization and nuclear localization and thereby controls E2-ERα-regulated geneexpression. Aim 2. Background: In CRISPR/Cas9 generated cell lines expressing constitutively active ERαmutants, the UPR is activated and ERα is partially resistant to antagonists. Identify the mechanism bywhich UPR activation contributes to drug resistance. Test the hypothesis that drug resistance in thesecells arises in part because ERα, together with progesterone-PR, synergistically activate the UPR, inducingBiP chaperone, which stabilizes ERα, thereby contributing to drug resistant gene expression. Aim 3. Identifycomponents of the multiprotein complex by which E2-ERα initiates the pathway. Using an unbiasedCRISPR/Cas9 lethality screen, followed by verification and analysis of multiprotein complexes, we will identifythe activating kinase(s), scaffolding proteins, other components of the complex(es), genes that impact thepathway and probe ERα interactions in the complex.These studies will establish the initial events that occur when estrogen contacts a cell and identify newmechanisms coupling steroid receptor regulated transcription to extranuclear signals."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Estrogenic and antiestrogenic compounds that bind in the estrogen receptor (ER) ligand binding pocket have played key roles in developing our understanding of ER action. The antiestrogenic compound, tamoxifen (Tam), is used extensively to treat breast cancer, but its long-term use is limited because tumors eventually develop tamoxifen resistance. We developed a high throughput screening strategy to identify small molecules that target ER action at the level of ER binding to its DNA response element, rather than the traditional approach of targeting antagonism of estrogen binding. Our lead ER inhibitor, TPSF, potently and specifically inhibits estrogen-ER-mediated gene expression and estrogen-ER-dependent growth of Tam-sensitive MCF-7 cells and three Tam-resistant breast cancer cell lines. However, TPSF has no effect on growth of ER negative cells. The three Specific Aims of this proposal build on our recent identification of TPSF. (Aim 1) Optimize TPSF by using structure-activity relationships to guide synthesis of new compounds for screening and assess inhibitor efficacy, specificity and intracellular actions in cell-based assays using Tam-sensitive and Tam-resistant breast cancer cells. (Aim 2) Identify the site on ER1 that interacts with the inhibitors and their mode of action, and (Aim 3) Test TPSF, and the best inhibitor to emerge from optimization, in mouse xenograft models of Tam-sensitive and Tam-resistant breast cancer. Assays and methods: (Aim 1) We will test the efficacy, potency and specificity of each inhibitor in gene expression assays using ER, AR and GR and examine inhibition of ER actions that do not require direct binding of ER to DNA. Using Tam-sensitive and Tam-resistant breast cancer cells, we will evaluate the inhibitor's ability to alter endogenous gene expression, anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent cell growth and to re-sensitize breast cancer cells to killing by immune cells. We will test for extranuclear effects on the ERK pathway and other signal transduction pathways and for toxicity in long-term studies. To analyze the lead inhibitor's effects on gene expression patterns, we will perform microarray analysis in ER positive breast cancer cells and in non-tumorigenic breast cells. (Aim 2) To evaluate inhibitor-ER interaction in vitro and in cells, we will use ER mutants containing large ER domains and then do studies with smaller mutations. Photoaffinity labeling, NMR comparison of chemical shifts of free ER and ER-inhibitor complexes, and isothermal titration calorimetry will be used to assess direct interaction of the inhibitors with ER. If feasible, structural studies of ER domain-inhibitor complexes will be performed. We will evaluate potential inhibitor effects on ER dimerization, degradation, phosphorylation and synergy with known antagonists. (Aim 3) Using Tam-sensitive and Tam-resistant breast cancer cells, we will assess the ability of the inhibitors to block tumor growth or induce tumor regression. These small molecule inhibitors are powerful new probes for ER action in breast cancer."

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancers that depend on estrogens bound to estrogen receptor for their growth eventually become resistant to drugs that target estrogen. We have identified new inhibitors that bypasses the site targeted by current drugs and instead target an essential action of the estrogen receptor. Further development of these inhibitors may lead to clinically useful drugs effective against tumors that are resistant to current therapies."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Estrogens and progestins, acting through the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) are implicated in the growth and metastases of many breast cancers. Tamoxifen, and other drugs that modify ER and PR action bind in the receptor's ligand binding pocket and lead to development of resistant tumors. We recently developed a novel fluorescence anisotropy microplate assay (FAMA). We used the FAMA to analyze the interaction of liganded ER and PR with their DNA response elements and with a full-length co-activator (SRC1) and demonstrated FAMA's potential for high throughput screening (HTS) assays. We will use the FAMA to develop HTS assays for identification of new classes of ER and PR antagonists targeted at different steps in ER and PR action. The Specific Aims are: 1. We will develop an HTS assay for small molecules that interfere with binding of ER and PR to their respective DNA response elements (EREs and the PRE/GRE) and that exhibit selectivity for ER and PR. 2. We will develop an HTS assay for compounds that interfere with binding of the co-activators SRC1 and Amplified in Breast Cancer 1 (AIB1) to ERE-E2: ER complexes. 3. We will develop HTS assays for small molecules that stimulate the ability of heat shock proteins and chaperones to disassemble complexes of ER and PR with DMA response elements, and with co-activators. HTS suitability studies and assay validation will include analysis of FAMA's precision, quality (Z1 and Z factor), spiking with known inhibitors, and controls for compound fluorescence. For each assay, we will screen approximately 3,000 compounds. Verification assays on candidate and control small molecules will include EMSA, effects on estrogen-dependent growth of breast cancer cells, transient transfections, quantitative RT-PCR of ER and PR-induced cell mRNAs, chromatin IP and RNAi of target proteins. These studies target novel sites for antagonizing cancer cell growth and metastases, and are prototypes for FAMA-based HTS assays."
"DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract): Aim 1 addresses the role of estrogen response elements in determining gene activation. The hypothesis addresses whether DNA binding acts as an allosteric effector to direct ER conformation which in turn leads to recruitment of coactivators or corepressors. The role of ER affinity for particular EREs and the induction of different conformations by the ERE that alters ER interaction with coregulators will be investigated. The effect of increased ER binding to the ERE will be determined in relation to coregulator interaction and transactivation when bound to estradiol and 4-hydroxytamoxifen. ER domains involved in communicating specific ERE binding to coregulator interactions will be established. Aim 2 makes use of ER bound to different imperfect EREs to determine the effect of exchanging EREs in native promoters to test coregulator recruitment, activity in cell-free transcription assays and in transiently and stably transfected cell lines. In aim 3, a cell free system of deproteinized templates will be used to identify rate limiting ER coregulators. A chromatin assembly system is proposed to test the effects of DNA replication, nucleosome assembly and position, cell specific factors, and histone deacetylation. In aim 4, stably transfected ER+ HepG2 cells will be used to test whether elongation rather than initiation is limiting in ER induction of vitellogenin gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays will be performed to identify differences in the patterns of ER and HNF3a binding and histone acetylation when transcription of the estrogen inducible VIT and PI-9 promoters is weakly or strongly activated."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The innate immune system performs the critical task of immediately protecting the host from infection and generating responses that alert and guide the actions of acquired immunity. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are essential elements of innate immunity which upon direct recognition of microbial, fungal and viral components activate cellular events leading to inflammation, direct killing of the pathogen, and enhanced antigen presentation. Their essential role in inducing and regulating these events, is evidenced by their direct association with a variety of immune disorders ranging from sepsis, atherosclerosis, arthritis, asthma and autoimmunity. Among the ten member TLR family, TLR2 requires TLR1 or TLR6 to recognize, discriminate and initiate responses to a wide variety of rnicrobial components. Host responses are mediated by the two cytoplasmic proximal adaptor molecules known as MyD88 and TIRAP/MAL. The long term goal of this project is to define the mechanism by which this subfamily of TLRs recognize their agonists, initiate cellular responses, and coordinate these responses at the subcellular and molecular level. The specific aims are 1) To define the precise role of TLRs 1 and 6 in recognition of microbial and fungal components as well as the extracellular regions of the receptors involved, 2) To determine the intracellular trafficking and physical interactions among TLRs 1, 2 and 6 and the proximal adaptor molecules MyD88 and TIRAP/ MAL upon agonist-mediated cell activation, and 3) To define the role of proximal signaling events; on the observed cell surface colocalization of TLRs and other TLR-associated endocytic trafficking events. The specific function of TLRs, with respect to agonist discrimination as well as the structural basis of this discrimination, are assessed through the use of synthetic; agonists and receptor domain swapping experiments. The localization of TLRs and adaptors are assessed through direct microscopy including FRET, membrane fractionation, and pharmacalogic agents. The effect of dominant negative molecules, shRNA and pharmacalogic agents address the role of signaling events on intracellular TLR trafficking."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Through the recognition of viral, microbial and fungal components, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) serve the critical role of alerting the host to the presence of infectious organisms. In response to these non-self structures, TLRs activate intracellular signaling cascades that are ultimately tailored to protect the host from the type of invading pathogen. Among the ten member TLR family, TLR2 requires TLR1 or TLR6 to recognize, discriminate and initiate responses to a wide variety of microbial components. Tailored host responses are achieved by recruitment of adaptor molecules specific for the TLRs that are engaged. The studies proposed here address the precise function, physical interactions and mechanism of microbial induced activation of TLR2 in association with TLR1, TLR6 and the adaptor molecules MyD88 and TIRAP/MAL. The specific function of TLR1 and TLR6 with respect to agonist discrimination and the structural basis of this discrimination are assessed through the use of synthetic agonists and receptor domain swapping experiments. The effect of abrogating endogenous receptor or adaptor molecule expression/activity on signaling and global gene induction is evaluated in order to delineate the specific role of each signaling component during pathogen-induced cellular activation. The mechanism underlying signal initiation is addressed through studies of the subcellular movement, physical interactions and protein modifications of the receptors and their adaptor molecules as a result of agonist encounter."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies of pathogenic Yersinia spp. over the last several decades have provided important insights into the molecular mechanisms of bacterial virulence. However, our understanding of the immunology of Yersinia infection remains relatively primitive. Previous observations demonstrate that a specific Th1 response is critical for the clearance of Yersinia infection in mice, but the role of B cells in host defense against Yersinia has not been well studied. The broad, long-term objective of our research is to use a variety of mouse models to gain a detailed understanding of host factors that are important in mediating resistance or susceptibility to Yersinia and ultimately to use this knowledge to develop immune therapies for human plague. The focus of this project is to establish a role for host B cells in Yersinia pathogenesis by analyzing immune response to Yersinia infection in wild type, B cell-deficient (BCR-/-}, and RAG-1-/- mice. We found that animals devoid of B cells exhibit enhanced early resistance to systemically administered Yersinia. However, BCR-/- mice that have survived an initial low-dose infection become only slightly more resistant than naive BCR-/- animals to re-challenge by a high dose of Yersinia. These observations suggest that B cells can inhibit innate immune response to Yersinia but they are also involved in either the generation of effector T cells, or the maintenance of memory T cells, or both. Our goals are to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which B cells modulate both innate immunity and primary and memory T-cell response during Yersinia infection. To achieve these goals, the pattern of cytokine production by B cells in response to Yersinia and Yersinia -secreted products will be analyzed, and the role of cytokines such as IL-10, lL-6, and TGF-beta in B cell-mediated inhibition of innate immunity to Yersinia infection will be examined. In addition, BCR-/- mice that lack certain subset of T cells will be generated and analyzed to determine whether BCR-/- mice are defective in T-cell response during Yersinia infection and which subset of T-cell response is defective. lgHEL BCR-/- mice will also be generated, and these animals can produce only hen egg lysozyme-specific B cells. Analysis of Yersinia infection in lgHEL BCR-/- mice will determine whether Yersinia -nonspecific B cells can correct the defective T-cell response observed in BCR-/- mice and whether cognate antigen presentation by B cells is required for the induction of a Th2 response. Furthermore, BCR-/- and lgHEL BCR-/- mice that have survived a primary infection will be re-challenged with a high dose of Yersinia and T-cell response will be analyzed to determine whether B cells and antibodies play a role in the maintenance of memory T cells. A detailed understanding of how Yersinia infection is cleared and how immunological memory is maintained will lead to informed decision on how best to design an anti-plague therapy."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toll-like receptors (TLRs) provide a critical link between the innate and adaptive immune system by sensing microbes and inducing dendritic cell maturation events needed for the activation of T cell responses. Additionally, TLR subsets are expressed in B lymphocytes where they have intrinsic activities which include the promotion of antibody production and maintenance of long term memory. Despite considerable research on TLRs the function of TLR10, which is highly expressed in B cells, remains unknown largely due to a lack of identifiable signaling responses and activating ligands. This knowledge gap is exacerbated by the fact that TLR10 is an inactive pseudogene in mice. This proposal overcomes these barriers through the development and use of research tools which include activating anti-TLR10 antibodies and a TLR10 transgenic mouse model. The overarching goal of this proposal is to characterize TLR10 expression and function within the B cell lineage. This goal is addressed through studies which aim: 1) to fully characterize the profile and regulation of TLR10 expression within the human B cell lineage; 2) to characterize the in vitro function of TLR10 in modulating B cell activity; 3) to define the role of TLR10 in the modulating class switch recombination; 4) to examine the role of TLR10 in regulating antigen-specific adaptive immune responses. These studies have considerable implications for the development of vaccines that are effective in humans and for autoimmune conditions such as lupus where dysregulated TLR activity plays a clear B cell intrinsic role."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic plague and represents a serious bioterrorism threat. Most studies on Y. pestis pathogenesis have been directed at identifying and defining the function of the many virulence factors that enable this organism to subvert host defenses. In contrast, relatively few studies have directly examined those immune responses that might be critical for effective host defense against Y. pestis. This proposal takes an unbiased approach aimed at defining the mechanistic basis of resistance of BALB/cJ mice to infection by Y. pestis which appears to be mediated by the early defenses of phagocytes. The first aim of this proposal is to determine the genetic basis of resistance of BALB/cJ mice through classical forward genetic screening and fine mapping of the resistance locus called plague resistance locus 1 (prl1). This analysis will becoupled with phagocyte gene expression data from resistance and susceptible strains. The second aim of this proposal examines BALB/cJ macrophages and neutrophils in vitro for enhanced phagocytic and bactericidal activity as well as resistance to Y. pestis cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Aim 2 will also comparatively examine the bacterial burdens and viability of splenic macrophages and neutrophils at early time points following Y. pestis infection of resistant and susceptible mouse strains. The critical role of neutrophils in BALB/cJ resistance will be assessed though adoptive transfer of these innate immune cells from resistant prl1 strains to susceptible mice. The findings from these studies will not only lead to a better understanding of host defense against Y. pestis in rodent populations, which constitute the major environmental reservoir for this pathogen, but may be generally applicable toward understanding human immunity to this pathogen. The host defenses essential for resistance to Y. pestis are likely to be novel and could define early innate immune targets for therapeutic intervention following infection."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that plays fundamental roles during embryogenesis and in adult stem cells. Dysregulation of Hh signaling has severe consequences in humans, ranging from birth defects to the development of basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and many other tumors. Many human disease-associated mutations have been identified in Hh pathway components. Regulation of the Hh pathway has therefore attracted considerable attention from both basic and clinical- scientists. The Hh pathway can be regulated at multiple levels. The Gli family of transcription factors act at the end of the Hh signaling cascade to control the expression of Hh target genes. Therefore, it is possible that abnormalities in the Hh pathway can be corrected by modulating the function of Gli proteins in human patients. However, it remains largely unclear how the transcriptional activation function of Gli is regulated. Genetic studies in zebrafish have identified Daz interacting protein 1 (Dzip1) as a regulator of Gli. Based on phenotypic characterization of zebrafish mutants deficient in Dzip1, it was proposed that Dzip1 regulates the function of Gli by antagonizing Suppressor of Fused (SuFu), an inhibitor of Gli. However, this hypothesis has not been tested vigorously. Recent studies in Drosophila and our work in vertebrates have demonstrated that B565, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), regulates the transactivation function of Gli through an as yet unclear mechanism. In an effort to understand how B565 regulates the function of Gli, we found that B565, Dzip1, and SuFu interact functionally and biochemically and are involved in a novel Gli regulatory mechanism. We show that B565 and Dzip1 act upstream of SuFu and antagonize the function of SuFu. Strikingly, Hh signaling triggers dephosphorylation of Dzip1. Depletion of B565, which physically interacts with Dzip1, enhances phosphorylation of Dzip1, suggesting that the B565-containing PP2A dephosphorylates Dzip1 directly. These preliminary results have led to the hypothesis that Hh signaling releases the inhibitory effect of SuFu on Gli by regulating B565-dependent Dzip1 dephosphorylation. The work will proceed with the following Specific Aims: Aim1: To determine whether B565 is required for Hh signaling-induced dephosphorylation of Dzip1. Aim2: To determine whether B565 regulates the function of Dzip1 in the Hh pathway. Aim3: To determine whether the dephosphorylated form of Dzip1 antagonizes SuFu. It is widely believed that mechanistic studies of the Hh pathway will identify important therapeutic targets and ultimately lead to more effective therapies for a wide range of cancers in human. Completion of the above studies will likely uncover an important mechanism of Gli regulation and lead to new therapeutic approaches."

In an effort to understand how B565 regulates the function of Gli, we found that B565, Dzip1, and SuFu interact functionally and biochemically and are involved in a novel Gli regulatory mechanism. We show that B565 and Dzip1 act upstream of SuFu and antagonize the function of SuFu. Strikingly, Hh signaling triggers dephosphorylation of Dzip1. Depletion of B565, which physically interacts with Dzip1, enhances phosphorylation of Dzip1, suggesting that the B565-containing PP2A dephosphorylates Dzip1 directly. These preliminary results have led to the hypothesis that Hh signaling releases the inhibitory effect of SuFu on Gli by regulating B565-dependent Dzip1 dephosphorylation. The work will proceed with the following Specific Aims: Aim1: To determine whether B565 is required for Hh signaling-induced dephosphorylation of Dzip1. Aim2: To determine whether B565 regulates the function of Dzip1 in the Hh pathway. Aim3: To determine whether the dephosphorylated form of Dzip1 antagonizes SuFu. It is widely believed that mechanistic studies of the Hh pathway will identify important therapeutic targets and ultimately lead to more effective therapies for a wide range of cancers in human. Completion of the above studies will likely uncover an important mechanism of Gli regulation and lead to new therapeutic approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mutations in human Hh pathway components cause birth defects and tumorigenesis. Pharmaceutical companies are actively developing drugs targeting the Hh pathway for the treatment of cancers. Because available compounds target Smoothened, they have no effect on tumors with Hh pathway activating mutations at the level of Smo or downstream. Thus, it is important to identify additional therapeutic targets in the Hh pathway. Gli proteins function at the downstream end of the Hh pathway to regulate the expression of Hh target genes. We have identified a novel Gli regulatory mechanism. Further investigation into this novel Gli regulatory mechanism will open a new avenue to the translational research and significantly advance our understanding of the Hh pathway."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that plays fundamental roles during embryogenesis and in adult stem cells. Dysregulation of Hh signaling has severe consequences in humans, ranging from birth defects to the development of basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and many other tumors. Many human disease-associated mutations have been identified in Hh pathway components. Regulation of the Hh pathway has attracted considerable attention from both basic and clinical-scientists. The Hh pathway can be regulated at multiple levels. The Gli family of transcription factors act at the end of the Hh signaling cascade to control the expression of Hh target genes. Therefore, it is possible that abnormalities in the Hh pathway can be corrected by modulating the function of Gli proteins in human patients. However, although many regulators of the Hh pathway have been identified, it remains largely unclear how the transcriptional activation function of Gli is regulated. Genetic studies in zebrafish have identified Daz interacting protein 1 (Dzip1) as a regulator of Gli. Based on phenotypic characterization of zebrafish mutants deficient in Dzip1, it was proposed that Dzip1 regulates the function of Gli by inhibiting Suppressor of Fused (SuFu), an inhibitor of Gli. However, this hypothesis has not been tested molecularly. Recent studies in Drosophila and our work in vertebrates have demonstrated that B56e, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), regulates the transactivation function of Gli through an as yet unclear mechanism. In an effort to understand how B56e regulates Gli activity, we found that B56e and Dzip1 physically interact. We were able to show that Dzip1 synergizes with Gli1 in mammalian culture cells and is required for the expression of Hh target genes in Xenopus embryo. Most strikingly, we found that Dzip1 forms a complex with SuFu in mammalian culture cells. These preliminary results raise the intriguing possibility that Dzip1 and B56e, which directly interact with each other, are involved in an important Gli regulatory pathway. Interestingly, inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) in zebrafish promotes nuclear localization of Dzip1, indicating that Dzip1 is regulated by the antagonistic interaction between protein kinase(s) and protein phosphatase(s). Thus, we hypothesize that B56e regulates Gli activity through dephosphorylating Dzip1. Specific aims are: Aim1: To determine whether B56e regulates Dzip1 phosphorylation. Aim2: To determine whether B56e regulates the function of Dzip1 in the Hh pathway. Aim3: To determine whether B56e antagonizes the function of SuFu. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mutations in human Hh pathway components cause birth defects and tumorigenesis. In principle, abnormalities in the Hh pathway can be corrected by modulating the activity of Gli proteins in human patients. Our preliminary studies have led to the observation that Dzip1 and B56e, which regulate Gli activity, directly interact with each other. We design experiments here to test the hypothesis that Dzip1 and B56e are involved in a novel Gli regulatory pathway. These studies will likely uncover an important mechanism of Gli regulation and accelerate the development of tools for correcting Hh signaling in human patients."
"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The germline is the only cell lineage capable of giving rise to the gametes. Defective germline development results in reduction or elimination of germ cells and ultimately causes infertility in humans, which affects 10- 15% of couples. Germ cell development begins early during embryonic development. After specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs), transcription is transiently repressed in PGCs. This is in stark contrast to the development of somatic lineages, which often relies on the activation of complex transcriptional programs. The establishment of such a transient genome-wide transcriptionally repressive state is critically important for early stages of the germline development, because it prevents PGCs from responding to surrounding signals that specify somatic cell fates. Failure to repress transcription during early stages of PGC development causes somatic differentiation and apoptosis of PGCs, which eventually leads to elimination of germ cells from the embryo. Understanding how this global transcriptionally repressive state is established in PGCs thus is highly relevant to human reproductive health. Our preliminary studies suggest that Dnd1, a RNA-binding protein required for vertebrate germ cell development, plays an essential role in establishing the genome- wide transcriptionally repressive state in PGCs. We found that Dnd1 protein is rapidly degraded by autophagy, making it intrinsically unstable. During development, Dnd1 is expressed at the right time and in the right place, and is required for the expression of Nanos1, which represses transcription in PGCs. We hypothesize that the genome-wide transcriptionally repressive state in PGCs is established through precisely regulated expression of Dnd1 protein. Specific aims are: Aim 1: To determine if Dnd1 is a central upstream regulator of the transcriptional repression in PGCs. Aim 2: To investigate the mechanisms through which Dnd1 regulates nanos1 translation. Aim 3: To determine whether autophagy- dependent Dnd1 turnover is important for the germline development."
