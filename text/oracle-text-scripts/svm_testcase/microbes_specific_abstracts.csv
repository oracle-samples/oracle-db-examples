"Persistent infection with Helicobacter pylori is an important risk factor for a number of serious gastric disorders in humans, including the development of gastric ulcer disease or gastric adenocarcinomas. The vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) is an important virulence factor that mounting evidence indicates is involved in multiple aspects of H. pylori-mediated colonization, persistence, and pathophysiology. The broad, long-term objective of this research program is to identify how the cellular modulating activities of VacA contribute to the pathogenesis strategies of H. pylori within the host. In this application, we propose to explore two important aspects of VacA cellular intoxication. In Specific Aim 1, we propose experiments to investigate the mechanism underlying recent observations that VacA induces caspasedependent programmed cell death in a mitochondrial-dependent manner. Specifically, we will explore the hypothesis that VacA directly elaborates an activity at mitochondria to induce mitochondrial fission as the trigger that ultimately results in programmed cell death. The proposed experiments are important for revealing aspects of an emerging strategy used by several pathogens to directly target mitochondria as a strategy for modulating host cell death. In Specific Aim 2, we will explore the interactions of VacA with plasma membrane sphingomyelin, which we have identified as an important determinant for both conferring cellular sensitivity to VacA as well as binding the toxin to the cell surface. These studies will reveal novel aspects of the mechanisms underlying cellular intoxication, as well as new approaches for blocking cellular intoxication. Because it is estimated that the prevalence of H. pylori infection is nearly 50% worldwide, the importance of developing efficacious vaccines, chemotherapeutics, and diagnostics for H. pylori cannot be overstated. These studies will not only contribute to our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of VacA-mediated cytotoxicity, but may reveal novel strategies for the prevention or treatment of H. pylori-mediated disease."

The broad objective of this research program is to identify how the cellular modulating activities of VacA contribute to the pathogenesis strategies of H. pylori within the host.

In Specific Aim 1, we propose experiments to investigate the mechanism underlying recent observations that VacA induces caspase-dependent programmed cell death in a mitochondrial-dependent manner. In Specific Aim 1, we will explore the overall hypothesis that VacA localizes to mitochondria and elaborates a biochemical activity that modulates mitochondrial membrane permeability. We will test a number of predictions of this hypothesis related to the mechanism of VacA-induced changes in membrane permeability, and how these changes relate to downstream consequences within the cell. Moreover, we will test the prediction that VacA is 'hard-wired' with sequences or motifs to target the toxin to mitochondria and then engage existing mitochondrial import machinery. In these studies, we will employ both cultured cell lines, as well as isolated mitochondria. The proposed experiments are important for revealing aspects of an emerging strategy used by several pathogens to directly target mitochondria as a strategy for modulating host cell death. In Specific Aim 2, we will explore the interactions of VacA with specialized microdomains of the plasma membrane of target cells that have been demonstrated to be important for cellular activity. We will explore the overall hypothesis that VacA associates with and functionally lipid rafts on the plasma membrane of target host cells. In this Aim, we will investigate the dependency of different VacA cellular activities on lipid rafts, as well as the functional relationship between lipid rafts and a known receptor for VacA. We will then explore how the lipid composition affects VacA association with rafts. Finally, we will identify and characterize VacA sequences and/or motifs that promote binding to lipid rafts. These studies will reveal novel aspects of the mechanisms underlying cellular intoxication, as well as new approaches for blocking cellular intoxication. Because it is estimated that the prevalence of H. pylori infection in developed countries is 20-50%, and 70-90% in developing countries, the importance of developing efficacious vaccines, chemotherapeutics, and diagnostics for H. pylori cannot be overstated. These studies will not only contribute to our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of VacA-mediated cytotoxicity, but may reveal novel strategies for blocking or minimizing the consequences of VacA-mediated cellular intoxication during infection."
"Helicobacter pylori is an etiologic agent of a number of gastric disorders in humans, including peptic ulceration and gastric adenocarcinomas. Early efforts to understand H. pylori pathogenesis revealed the presence of a secreted bacterial toxin (VacA) which mounting evidence indicates is an important virulence factor. VacA causes massive degenerative vacuolation of mammalian cells which has been implicated in the gastric epithelial erosion preceding the onset of peptic ulcer disease. The broad objective of this research program si to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms by which VacA mediates cellular cytotoxicity. Long-term milestones include identification of the biochemical activity and intracellular targets of VacA. Experiments in this proposal are designed to test the hypothesis that VacA mediates cellular cytotoxicity as an AB toxin. The model of VacA as an AB toxin is important because it suggests specific hypotheses directly relevant to the fundamental mechanism by which VacA enters host cells and induces vacuolation. The AB family of toxins share a number of distinct properties, and includes prominent members such as cholera, diphtheria, tetanus, and anthrax toxins. The specific aims in this proposal are designed to elucidate the VacA molecular structure and begin to identify structure-function relationships of the toxins. The specific aims are: [1] To identify cellular mechanisms of VacA cytotoxicity. To achieve these goals, novel VacA fusion proteins will be genetically constructed to determine if VacA is trafficked to the cytosol. In addition, radiolabeled VacA will be analyzed for intracellular proteolytic processing. [2] To identify VacA structural characteristics important to the toxin's cellular activities. To achieve these goals, mutant forms of VacA and novel fusion proteins will be genetically constructed to test hypotheses about VacA structure-function relationships and biochemical activities. Because it is estimated that the prevalence of H. pylori infection in developed countries is 20-50%, and 70-90% in developing countries, the importance of developing efficacious vaccines, chemotherapeutics, and diagnostics of H. pylori cannot be overstated. These studies will not only contribute to under understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of VacA-mediated cytotoxicity, but may reveal novel strategies for using attenuated VacA, or fragments of VacA is components in new protective vaccines."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Campylobacter jejuni is a food and water borne pathogen responsible for severe inflammatory diarrhea in humans. C. jejuni is a NIAID Category B Priority Pathogen because, in part, of the potential of this pathogen to be used as a biowarfare agent to contaminate food- and water supplies over large geographical areas. It is important to understand the basic biology of C. jejuni pathogenesis, which may lead to novel strategies for circumventing the use of this bacterium as a biowarfare agent. However, the pathogenic mechanisms used by C. jejuni to colonize and cause disease in the host are poorly understood. This application is a collaborative proposal between investigators at the University of Houston and UCLA to study the only known exotoxin secreted by C. jejuni. We will investigate the cellular mechanisms of the C. jejuni cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), which causes cell cycle arrest and eventual death of intoxicated mammalian cells, and has been proposed to assist in remodeling the in vivo environment to facilitate colonization of the intestinal tract. In this R21 application, we will begin to explore the hypothesis that CDT discriminates for and binds to a specific plasma membrane receptor on the surface of sensitive cells as an essential early step during cellular intoxication. In this application, we propose experiments for investigating at the molecular level the interactions of CDT with target cells. In Specific Aim 1, University of Houston researchers will characterize the interactions of CDT with sensitive mammalian cell lines. We will determine the specific and non-specific components as well as the affinity of CDT-receptor interactions. In addition, we will establish many how receptors are present per mammalian cell. Moreover, because CDT is a tri-partite toxin comprising three discrete subunits (CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC), we will establish the contribution of each subunit to binding of the toxin. Finally, we will begin to characterize the nature of the CDT receptor. These experiments will be important for establishing the framework for future experiments to identify the molecular basis for CDT receptor discrimination and binding. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify and characterize mutant cell lines that are resistant to CDT. UCLA researchers will use a genetic approach involving two fundamental phases. In phase 1, cell lines will be mutagenized and screened for a loss of sensitivity to CDT. In phase 2, the loss of sensitivity will be characterized, with the goal being the identification of a cell line that is deficient in binding to CDT. These experiments will be crucial for future work to complement the cell-binding defect, which will identify the putative CDT receptor. Results from this research will provide important information about the mechanism of CDT cellular intoxication, and will provide the basis for future work to develop strategies for blocking the action of CDT as an approach for attenuating C. jejuni pathogenesis."
"? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During inhalational anthrax, considerable evidence indicates that alveolar macrophages (m?s) contribute to the development of disseminated infection and disease by transporting dormant B. anthracis (Ba) spores, previously inhaled into the alveolar spaces of the lungs, to the bloodstream. Although the initial steps of spore uptake into m?s have been extensively studied, a major gap in knowledge, which is the focus of this exploratory R21 application, is the mechanism by which intracellular Ba escape infected m?s as a requisite step prior to extracellular dissemination. Here, we propose studies that challenge an existing model that predicts, analogous to several different intracellular pathogens, m? death must precede Ba release to the external environment. Instead, our preliminary data indicate that subsequent to phagocytic uptake of dormant spores into Bacillus-containing vacuoles (BCVs), a substantial fraction of intracellular Ba escape in the absence of m? killing. Because we find no evidence that Ba depart BCVs into the cytosol of infected m?s, we propose that these intracellular vacuoles represent specialized niches that are important for Ba escape. In support of this idea, infection with Ba enhances transport of lysosomal contents to the cell surface, and, induces the time-dependent enrichment of BCVs with the membrane vesicle fusion protein, synaptotagmin-7, consistent with an exocytic process. Based on these preliminary data, we will evaluate the overall hypothesis that non-lytic escape of intracellular Ba from infected m?s requires remodeling of BCVs from degradative to exocytic compartments. We will identify changes in BCV-associated proteins during the course of Ba infection, and, characterize their functional importance for the maturation of BCVs into compartments associated with egress of intracellular Ba back to the extracellular environment. These studies will provide the first detailed characterization of the intracellular niche occupied by Ba spores, and contribute to our understanding of the fundamental biology underlying inhalational anthrax."

"? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This exploratory R21 application proposes studies to identify and characterize the mechanism by which the vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA), an important virulence factor produced by the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, targets mitochondria within intoxicated host cells. VacA is a membrane-channel forming toxin, which subsequent to binding the surface of host cells, is taken up from the plasma membrane into VacA- containing vesicles (VCVs), and subsequently targets the inner membrane of mitochondria, resulting in metabolic dysfunction and cell death. Here, we propose studies that challenge canonical models of host cell intoxication by intracellular-acting bacterial toxins, whic generally require the translocation of enzymatic active fragments from the endolysosomal system or endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol prior to toxin- mediated modification of intracellular targets. Rather, subsequent to internalization, we propose that VacA is transported within VCVs to mitochondria, where the toxin is then directly transferred to mitochondria. However, the identity of VCV proteins important for VacA targeting/trafficking to mitochondria is difficult to predict, due in part to the fact that until very recently, mitochondria were not generlly thought to receive protein cargo from the endolysosomal system and, as a consequence, almost nothing is known about intracellular trafficking compartments destined for mitochondria. To address this gap in knowledge, we will evaluate the hypothesis that VacA-targeting of mitochondria requires remodeling of VacA-containing vesicles (VCVs) from early endosomal-like compartments to vesicles that are functionally competent for targeting and fusion with mitochondria. Using magnetic-based separation methods to isolate iron-enriched VCVs from cells at different stages of intoxication for proteome analysis, we will identify changes in VCV-associated proteins, and, characterize their functional importance for VacA targeting of mitochondria and mitochondrial dysfunction. These studies will provide the first detailed characterization of the host cell machinery that is important for mitochondrial targeting, and, contribute to our understanding of the fundamental biology underlying the modulation of host cells by VacA."

"The long-term objective underlying the research proposed within this exploratory R21 application is to understandhow host inflammation associated with the chronic human pathogen, Helicobacter pylori (Hp), fully impacts humanhealth and disease. The persistent inflammation localized within the gastric mucosa during chronic Hp infection isconsidered the major risk factor for the onset of gastric diseases, including gastric ulcer disease and gastricadenocarcinoma. However, persistent low-level systemic inflammation also accompanies Hp gastric infection, whichhas been increasingly associated with extra-gastric diseases. The major gap in knowledge to be addressed in thisapplication is the extent to which neuroinflammation, which is synonymous with brain inflammation, accompanieschronic gastric infection with Hp. In vivo animal infection studies, using Sprague-Dawley rats as an establishedmodel for studying cognitive performance, will be conducted to evaluate the previously unexplored hypothesisthat chronic gastric infection with Hp promotes neuroinflammation. Preliminary results support this hypothesis, byrevealing that elevated brain inflammation accompanies short-term gastric infection with Hp. Here, we propose studiesto extend the duration of Hp infection to study both systemic and neuroinflammation under conditions that moreclosely recapitulate chronic infection. To understand the underlying mediators of systemic and neuroinflammation,levels of innate immune inflammatory cytokines normally associated with Hp gastric infection will be monitored.Finally, the causal relationship between Hp infection and neuroinflammation will be explored by monitoringneuroinflammation in the brains of animals whose Hp infections were eradicated by antibiotic administration. Resultsfrom the studies proposed here will not only advance our understanding of the extra-gastric effects of chronicHp infection, but will also provide the necessary experimental framework for future collaborative studies toinvestigate the impact of neuroinflammation on the cognitive performance of animals chronically infected withHp."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed work is to continue studies of lipid metabolism in diverse bacteria some of which are human pathogens. Although many aspects of bacterial lipid metabolism were first worked out in the paradigm Escherichia coli, other bacteria differ from E. coli in various aspects. A focus will be on the last step of the fatty acid elongatin cycle, the enoyl-ACP reductase reaction, which is catalyzed by a set of very diverse proteins. Since fatty acids are an essential component of bacterial membrane lipids, several of these enzymes are the targets of antimicrobials. A second focus will be on the mechanisms of synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, an essential component of the membrane lipids of most bacteria. A major puzzle is the mechanism of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis in the Clostridia, which include a number of serious human pathogens. Further investigations of the mechanisms of synthesis of the fatty acid-derived vitamins, biotin and lipoic acid, which are essential enzymecofactors in all three domains of life, are proposed. Prior work provided the E. coli synthetic pathway in E. coli. However, some bacteria make these cofactors but lack one or more of the proteins used by. Current work is focused on the Firmicutes which include the Bacilli, Clostridia, Staphlococci and thus many important pathogens. In the case of lipoic acid synthesis Bacillus subtilis requires four proteins to synthesize this cofactor whereas E. coli required only two proteins. One of the essential proteins is a key subunit of an enzyme of single carbon metabolism and this interplay will be studied. The early part of biotin synthesis in Bacillus subtilis differs greatly from the pathway used by E. coli and this pathway will be dissected. A third pathway to be studied is that found in the a-proteobacteria (e.g., Brucella) which seems a variation of the E. coli pathway. Study of the mechanisms regulating the synthesis of the various biotin and lipoic acid synthetic pathways will also be done. The E. coli and Bacillus subtilis biotn regulatory systems are quite novel and not fully understood. Further study of these regulatory mechanisms is proposed. Finally, a new class of bacterial quorum sensing molecules the Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) fatty acids were recently discovered. These are cis-2-enoic acids of medium chain length which trigger breakdown of the biofilms formed by diverse bacteria and some fungi. Prior work demonstrated how the Burkholderia cenocepacia DSF is synthesized, but that enzyme is not fully understood or conserved in some other DSF- producing bacteria. Study of these pathways and mechanisms will use a wide array of genetic, biochemical, molecular biological, chemical and structural approaches."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is concerned with the molecular mechanisms that regulate the synthesis and degradation of membrane lipids in bacteria. The metabolism of two vitamins, lipoic acid and biotin, that are related to fatty acid synthesis are also studied. The general approaches are to use genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology to unravel these mechanisms and determine how these pathways are regulated. The mechanisms of fatty acid synthesis are highly conserved throughout biology thus giving these studies general applicability. However, in the case of fatty acid synthesis the details of the pathways differ sufficiently from those of mammals that specific inhibitors of the bacterial enzymes have been found. Therefore, bacterial fatty acid synthetic enzymes are excellent targets for new antibiotics. It should be noted that a group of protozoan parasites including those causing malaria and toxoplasmosis have essential fatty acid enzymes which are close homologues to the bacterial proteins and thus new antibiotics may prove effective versus these diseases. The same may be true of biotin synthesis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fatty acids are a major component of the membrane that separated the inside of bacterial cells from the external environment. This proposal studies how these acids are made and provides a basis for antibiotics that kill bacteria by blocking synthesis of fatty acids and hence bacterial cell growth."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is to study the biosynthesis, function, regulation, and possible role in bacterial pathogenesis of two modifications that alter the membrane phospholipid bilayers of bacteria. Both modifications alter the cis double bonds of the unsaturated acyl chains of the lipids after the lipids have been synthesized, deposited, and are functioning in the cell membranes. One of these modifications, cis-trans isomerization, is limited to a few families of bacteria whereas the other, cyclopropane ring formation is found in a very wide range of diverse bacteria. Both lipid modifications increase the resistance of the bacterium to environmental stresses. For example, cyclopropane ring formation increases resistance to acid conditions and may be of importance in survival of a water-borne pathogen as it passes through the stomach. Cis-trans isomerization results in improved fitness for growth at high temperature and resistance to certain toxic compounds. Both modifications are conserved in numerous pathogens and cyclopropane ring formation has been ascribed a role in Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis. These processes will be studied by a combination of biochemical, genetic, and molecular biological approaches including tests of pathogenesis in a mouse model system"
"The objectives of this proposal is to understand the mechanism whereby hydrophilic soluble proteins interact with membranes, specifically the membrane lipid component. Recent work indicates that many such interactions exist and play a multitude of cell roles such as sensory transduction. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved. Two enzyme systems will be studied. Both are enzymes of the bacterium, Escherichia coli. E. coli pyruvate oxidase is an enzyme greatly activated (500-fold in Kcat) upon binding to lipids, but is a soluble protein closely related to certain enzymes of amino acids biosynthesis. Prior work has suggested a model for this interaction whereby the C- termini of the enzyme penetrates into the lipid bilayer and this model shall be tested by biochemical and genetic means. Development of a new method to assay penetration of proteins into a lipid bilayer is proposed. The second enzyme is E. coli cyclopropane fatty acid (CFA) synthase, a novel enzyme that modifies the double bonds of phospholipids resident in a lipid bilayer. CFA synthase methylenates the double bond to form a cyclopropane ring, the methylene donor being S-adenosyl methionine. The purified enzyme is now available and its interaction with phospholipids can now be studied in detail."
"IN VITRO vs. IN VIVO FUNCTION The most reliable approach for establishing the in vivo function of an enzyme is by genetics coupled with biochemical analyses. Numerous examples demonstrate that the physiological roles assigned to enzymes based on in vitro reactions they catalyze are incorrect. In perhaps tne most famous example, Arthur Kornberg discovered DNA polymerase I which was thought to be the sole E. coli DNA polymerase and, therefore, must be responsible for DNA replication [2]. However, mutants lacking DNA polymerase I grew and made DNA normally; hence, DNA polymerase I could not be the replicatlve polymerase [3, 4]. The replicatlve polymerase later was shown to be DNA polymerase 111, a much more complicated enzyme that, given the reaction conditions and template used for DNA polymerase I, is virtually inactive. However, mutants of polymerase I are super-sensitive to both UV and mutagens, showing that the in vivo role of polymerase I is DNA repair [5]. Kornberg desen/ed the Nobel Prize, but the fact remains that the physiological role of DNA polymerase I was in error due to the lack of genetics. A less famous but immediately relevant example of the in vivo ambiguity of an In vitro assigned function is provided by the computationally predicted and experimentally verified assignments of the N-succinyl Arg/Lys racemase [6] and L-Ala-D/L-Phe dipeptide epimerase [7] functions to members the MLE subgroup of the enolase superfamily. In both examples, Jacobson (Computation Core) predicted substrate promiscuity that was confirmed by enzymatic assays (EN Bridging Project). However, for both enzymes, the identity of the in vivo substrate as well as the physiological importance of the reaction is unknown. The Microbiology Core will apply genetic analyses and metabolomics to determine the in vivo roles of enzymes for which the In vitro functions are predicted by the Computation Core and verified by the Bridging Projects. Enzymes that emerge from the bottom of the funnel of Figure 1 in the Program Summary may be active with one, a few, or many related substrates with varying catalytic efficiencies. Which substrate(s) do they use in vivo? A combination of bacterial genetics, phenotypic characterization, and metabolite analysis will enable the physiological roles of the EFI targets to be evaluated and assigned."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Eukaryotic cells are compartmentalized by membrane-bound organelles, which communicate with each other through the transport of cargo vesicles that culminates in membrane fusion. We use vacuolar lysosomes isolated from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to examine membrane fusion. Vacuolar fusion requires a group of regulatory lipids that includes phosphoinositides, ergosterol, phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol. Fusion occurs at membrane microdomains where regulatory lipids interdependently assemble with the proteins that catalyze fusion including SNAREs, the Rab GTPase Ypt7 the tethering complex HOPS, and actin. Because the lipid bilayer undergoes constant remodeling through lipid modification, we hypothesize that the metabolic interconversion of lipid species is integrally coupled to membrane fusion. In this proposal we examine the relationship between the lipid composition of vacuolar membranes and the function of SNAREs as well as the Rab7/Ypt7 nucleotide exchange factor Mon1. We plan to elucidate the role of lipid composition and the regulation of vacuole fusion by pursuing the following aims: 1 - Examine the function of SNARE trans-membrane domains during fusion and how these domains are controlled by the local lipid environment; 2 - Determine the role of lipid composition on kinetics of affinities of SNARE complex formation; 3 - Examine the relationship between the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and the recruitment and activation of the Rab7/Ypt7 nucleotide exchange factor Mon1. PUBLIC HEALTH RELAVANCE: Membrane fusion is essential for cell viability, neurotransmission, the secretion of antibodies and hormones, blood clotting, and the destruction of microbes. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism/modification is tied t many diseases including Charcot- Marie-Tooth disease, obesity, type-2 diabetes, and heart disease. In each case, membrane trafficking and fusion is deleteriously affected, yet the mechanisms that link lipid modification and the regulation of the fusion machinery remain unknown. The proposed study will define how the composition of the vacuolar membrane regulates SNARE and Mon1 function and will give us clues about the relationship between lipid modification and human health and disease."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Eukaryotic cells are compartmentalized by membrane-bound organelles, which communicate with each other through the transport of cargo vesicles that culminates in membrane fusion. We use vacuolar lysosomes isolated from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to examine membrane fusion. Vacuolar fusion requires a group of regulatory lipids that includes phosphoinositides, ergosterol, phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol. Fusion occurs at membrane microdomains where regulatory lipids interdependently assemble with the proteins that catalyze fusion including SNAREs, the Rab GTPase Ypt7 the tethering complex HOPS, and actin. Because the lipid bilayer undergoes constant remodeling through lipid modification, we hypothesize that the metabolic interconversion of lipid species is integrally coupled to membrane fusion. In this proposal we examine the relationship between the lipid composition of vacuolar membranes and the function of SNAREs as well as the Rab7/Ypt7 nucleotide exchange factor Mon1. We plan to elucidate the role of lipid composition and the regulation of vacuole fusion by pursuing the following aims: 1 - Examine the function of SNARE trans-membrane domains during fusion and how these domains are controlled by the local lipid environment; 2 - Determine the role of lipid composition on kinetics of affinities of SNARE complex formation; 3 - Examine the relationship between the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and the recruitment and activation of the Rab7/Ypt7 nucleotide exchange factor Mon1. PUBLIC HEALTH RELAVANCE: Membrane fusion is essential for cell viability, neurotransmission, the secretion of antibodies and hormones, blood clotting, and the destruction of microbes.

However, suffice it to say that proper membrane fusion is essential for cell viability and cellular functions that include the release of neurotransmitters, hormones and antibodies. Therefore, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of membrane fusion is critical if we are to understand the diseases that target this machinery."
"With combined advances in genetic screening and identification of clinical markers of prediabetes, diagnosis for future risk of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is close to practical reality. Critically missing are effective therapeutic strategies to preserve pancreatic beta-cell function once prediabetic individuals are identified. This application is based on the contention that elucidation of the molecular mechanisms operative during the early stages of beta-cell destruction would contribute greatly to the development of such intervention therapies. Our research is focused on understanding the phenotypic and functional changes that occur in beta-cells in response to interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), a potent T cell-derived cytokine present in insulitic lesions and required for IDDM development. Corroborating clinical findings, we have demonstrated that two major alterations occur in IFN-gamma-treated beta- cells - - diminished glucose responsiveness and induction of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen - processing pathway. The overall objective of the present proposal is to determine whether these two events are linked through an interactive mechanism. Our underlying hypothesis is that intracellular insulin content is diminished in IFNgamma-treated beta-cells because pre-proinsulin is diverted from the normal secretory pathway and used as a donor of antigenic peptides for MHC class I assembly. Experiments are designed to characterize, at the molecular level, the subunit composition and subcellular location of the proteolytic complex thought to generate class I peptides in IFNgamma- treated beta-cells. To determine if a cause-effect relationship exists between induction of this low molecular mass polypeptide (LMP) complex and diminished beta-cell function, glucose-stimulated insulin biosynthesis will be measured in beta-cells in which LMP gene expression is either extinguished or constitutively elevated. In addition, the endogenous peptides bound to beta-cell MHC class I molecules will be isolated and sequenced to determine if pre-proinsulin is a major peptide donor. Neither insulin RNA expression nor insulin secretory granule exocytosis are altered by IFNgamma. The inhibitory effect of IFNgamma on beta-cell function does however require gene transcription. Thus, IFNgamma's effects must be contributed by induced factors that either block translation of insulin mRNA, enhance insulin degradation, or both. To resolve these possibilities, studies are included that will distinguish IFNgamma's effects on biosynthesis, degradation, and trafficking of pre-proinsulin in glucose-stimulated beta-cells. As a reduction in glucose utilization might selectively block pre-proinsulin translation, glucose uptake and metabolism are also compared in control and IFNgamma-treated beta-cells. Collectively, these studies will define molecular mechanisms likely operative in the prediabetic beta-cell, thereby providing information critical for bridging the gap between diagnosis and treatment of IDDM."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of the research is to further understand the regulation of nitrogen flow to urea synthesis in humans. A specific focus is on patients with genetic disorders of the urea cycle (UCDs). Currently funded research has shown that inviduals who are heterozygotic for ornithine transcarbamylase and arginino succinic acid synthase deficiency appear to have a partial block in their ability to use glutamine as a nitrogen source for urea synthesis, and that they rely on the hepatic clearance of ammonia generated in the gut to maintain their post prandial N homeostasis. Preliminary results suggest that the administration of sodium phenyl butyrate, a common treatment for UCDs, disrupts branched chain amino acid metabolism. We argue therefore that because of the importance of leucine to protein metabolic regulation, treatment with phenyl butyrate not only diverts N away from urea synthesis, but compromises the regulation of body protein turnover. We hypothesize: Hypothesis 1: Phenyl butyrate, given at therapeutic levels, specifically diverts branched chain amino nitrogen towards glutamine production and away from net tissue protein synthesis. Hypothesis 2: Phenyl butyrate treatment thus inhibits the ability of the body to maintain nitrogen equilibrium, particularly at the restricted protein intakes used in the treatment of UCDs and other metabolic diseases; Hypothesis 3: Patients with UCDs, who are concurrently treated with phenylbutyrate and a low protein diet, will benefit from dietary supplements of branched chain amino acids.To test these hypotheses, we will use stable isotopic tracers of leucine, glutamine, phenylalanine and urea metabolism in studies in normal subjects and individuals with partial or complete defects in urea synthesis. The specific aims will be: Specific aim 1: Determine, in control subjects and heterozygotic carriers of UCDs, the effect of phenyl butyrate on urea, glutamine and branched chain amino acid metabolism. Quantify its effects on body protein turnover. Specific aim 2: Quantify whole body protein turnover and balance in patents with null urea cycle activity who are receiving the conventional regime of phenyl butyrate and a low protein diet. Specific aim 3: Determine the effect of oral branched chain-amino acid supplements on protein, leucine and glutamine metabolism in urea-cycle patients and controls who are receiving phenyl butyrate.The main objective therefore is to use the new clinically oriented information on the regulation of human nitrogen homeostasis, to develop novel nutritional approaches to the treatment of UCDs and other metabolic diseases. In addition it is anticipated that the results will benef it other individuals who have compromised protein metabolism."
"DESCRIPTION (Taken from the Investigator's Abstract) The idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, afflict approximately 0.1% of the population of the western world and result from multifactorial interactions between IBD susceptibility genes and environmental agents. The working model of this proposal addresses the role of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the initiation and progression of IBD. Sulfidogenic bacteria are members of the normal intestinal microbiota and are characterized by their ability to use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor, culminating in the production of the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The investigator postulates that exogenous sulfate can enhance H2S production and thereby trigger colonic inflammation. They further propose that IBD may reflect a predisposing genetic background that causes abnormal sensitivity to SRB-generated H2S. Damage of the colonic epithelium by H2S would promote translocation of bacterial and food antigens, resulting in inflammatory responses to normally benign antigens, an outcome consistent with much circumstantial data and the histopathological features of IBD. The experimental approach uses a novel molecular ecology strategy to examine the development of SRB population in the mouse intestine and to define the effects of drinking water sulfate on their diversity and metabolic activities. A mouse model of IBD is then used to test the hypothesis that drinking water sulfate can trigger colonic inflammation through bacterial H2S production. Confirmation of a role for bacterial-generated sulfide in experimental colitis would represent the first conclusive evidence for environmental modulation of normal gut bacteria contributing to a genetically encoded inflammatory disorder. That finding would intensify efforts to obtain corroborative data from human subjects and would present a novel target for prophylactic or therapeutic treatments for IBD."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal originates from our observations of a three to four fold increase in the number of acidomucin-positive goblet cells accompanied by glutathione (GSH) depletion in the small intestinal mucosa of neonatal pigs being nourished parenterally. We hypothesize that the lack of luminal cysteine is the primary insult perceived by the parenterally nourished epithelium, and that the functional endpoint of this nutritional deficiency is a more oxidized intracellular redox potential The identification of this amino acid as a key nutritional factor is based on (a) the high rate of first-pass consumption of dietary cysteine and the low rate of arterial cysteine utilization by the intestine; (b) evidence that cellular redox status is a key determinant of cellular differentiation, and (c) the fact that cysteine is structurally and functionally involved in both intracellular redox status and mucosal defense via its inherent contribution to the thiol buffers GSH and thioredoxin (Trx) on one hand, and the goblet cell-specific secretory mucins and intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) on the other. We hypothesize that parenteral nutrition results in a preferential activation of the mucous cell lineage as well as selective sparing of goblet cells leading to the repopulation (at a reduced rate) of the villus with goblet cells relative to absorptive enterocytes. The alteration in goblet cell development is initiated by hyperoxia that stems from compromised cysteine status. In other words, we hypothesize that goblet cells are the guardians of mucosal redox homeostasis. Our hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Determine if a causal relationship exists between epithelial redox status and goblet cell expansion, independent of TPN-associated inflammation. 2) Quantify, in a goblet cell culture model system, the hierarchy of cysteine usage for the synthesis of GSH and Trx versus ITF and secretory mucins, as well as the role of the transsulfuration pathway in the formation of cysteine and sulfate from methionine, as affected by apical versus basal provision of cysteine, and in response to graded levels of hyperoxia. Simultaneously, determine if the source (inorganic vs. cysteine-derived) and flux of sulfate used for sulfomucin biosynthesis is affected by cysteine availability and hyperoxic stress. 3) Test the hypothesis that Cysl31 and/or Cys165, found within the activation domain of Cdx2, are redox sensitive and upon post-translational modification alter the specificity of Cdx2 transcriptional regulation."
"? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed are innovative studies designed to investigate the biological basis of the increased risk for the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) independently associated with being African American (AA) or consuming a diet high in red meat and saturated fat. We hypothesize that the primary bile salt taurocholic acid (TCA) is a key diet-controlled metabolite whose use by the bacteria Bilophila wadsworthia and Clostridium scindens yields a carcinogen and tumor-promoter, respectively. The work is motivated by our extensive collection of published data indicating H2S and secondary bile acid production by colonic bacteria serve as key environment insults contributing to CRC risk. First we will examine differences between at-risk AAs and non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) in mucosal abundance of bacterial genes associated with sulfur and bile acid metabolism, markers of bile metabolism in serum and stool, and colonic inflammation. Rationale is provided by our intriguing observation that mucosal abundance of a bacterium (B. wadsworthia) that uses the sulfur amino acid taurine, which is abundant in red meat, is a strong predictor of CRC in AA but not NHW subjects. Bacterial deconjugation of the bile acid taurocholate provides another source of taurine, and once deconjugated, free primary bile acids are further metabolized by colonic bacteria to genotoxic and proinflammatory secondary bile acids. We will then test the hypothesis that a diet high in animal protein and saturated fat creates a metabolic milieu in the colon that promotes risk for CRC in at-risk AAs by increasing the abundance and activity of bacteria that generate genotoxic sulfide and secondary bile acids. Rationale for focusing the diet intervention on AAs comes from the observation regarding a taurine respiring bacterium distinguishing AA but not NHW CRC patients from healthy controls and our prior work in AAs that focused on mechanisms underlying the increased risk for CRC associated with consumption of a Western type diet. We will conduct a prospective randomized crossover feeding trial that examines two microbial mechanisms by which an animal-based diet may support the growth of bacteria that generate the genotoxic and proinflammatory end products, H2S and secondary bile acids, through the metabolism of TCA. An animal- based diet rich in taurine and saturated fat will be compared with a plant-based diet low in taurine and saturated fat. Subjects will receive each of the two diets in a crossover design thereby serving as their own control. A mediation model will be used to determine the extent to which the relationship between diet [independent variable] and mucosal markers of CRC risk and DNA damage [dependent variables] is explained by colonic bacteria and their functions [mediator variables]. This research will generate novel information on a mechanistically targeted nutrient aimed to develop effective cancer prevention interventions based simply on diet that may contribute to a reduction in the unequal CRC burden in AAs."

"Oxidative stress has a large imprint upon biology: It determines the structure of microbial communities,is central to the action of the innate immune system, and is suspected of underlying a variety of humanpathologies. Several basic questions frame the field: How are oxidants formed, and in what quantities? Whatare the specific biomolecules that they damage most rapidly? How do cells defend themselves? Why doesoxidant sensitivity differ among organisms? Mechanistic details have primarily emerged from studies of the model bacterium E. coli. Thisapplication proposes to deepen and broaden the understanding. To date the reactive oxygen species (ROS)O2 and H2O2 are known to disrupt growth primarily by inactivating cluster-dependent dehydratases and non- -redox mononuclear iron enzymes. Dehydratases are vulnerable in virtually all organisms. However, it appearsthat the mononuclear enzymes of some aerobes acquired resistance by employing divalent metals other thaniron. Such an evolutionary adaptation would be fascinating, as it would recapitulate a tactic that E. coli invokesduring oxidative stress. Aim One will test whether this substitution is driven by changes in the intracellularmetal pools or by modifications of the enzymes, and it will probe whether the shift in metallation exerts a cost incatalytic efficiency. Aim Two investigates the hypothesis that radical SAM enzymes comprise a novel third class of ROS-sensitive enzyme. Circumstantial data support the idea: they employ over-oxidizable peripheral iron-sulfurclusters, and E. coli responds to stress by replacing one of these enzymes with a cluster-free analogue. Yetthose clusters might plausibly be protected in vivo either by bound SAM or by rapid re-reduction via their nativeelectron donor. If this enzyme family is ROS-sensitive, then stress will affect a broad range of cell processes. Transcriptomic analyses have revealed surprising strategies by which E. coli copes with ROS, and AimThree probes two newly discovered ones. First, the ClpSA and ClpX unfoldases somehow stabilize branched-chain biosynthesis during periods of H2O2 stress. The mechanism may be that by acting as chaperones theClp proteins protect apo-dehydratases from aggregation and/or proteolysis. Thus damaged clusters can be re-built. Second, the data reveal that H2O2-stressed cells induce exonuclease III, a key enzyme that is specificallyrequired to repair oxidative DNA lesions. The work will determine how its expression is controlled, whetherother repair enzymes are co-regulated, and which enzymes are needed to allow growth in the face ofenvironmental H2O2. Finally, Aim Four extends prior investigations of the molecular basis of obligate anaerobiosis. Previouswork identified two key enzymes that are poisoned upon aeration of a model anaerobe; the next step is toresolve the underlying mechanisms. As proof of principle, this Aim will culminate in an effort to construct aderivative strain whose central metabolism is not blocked by oxygen. These projects are selected to fill in key pieces of the puzzle of oxidative stress. They are closelyinterconnected, with the mechanistic theme being the incompatibility of oxygen and iron-centered metabolism.Each Aim derives directly from data obtained during the current funding period."
"We seek to understand the impact that oxidative stress has upon organisms by addressing three overarching questions: How are reactive oxygen species formed in biological environments? What biomolecules do they damage? And how do cells defend themselves against them? We have employed E. coli as a model organism, in part because we have such a detailed understanding of its physiology and biochemistry, and in part because this facultative anaerobe can be genetically manipulated in the absence of oxygen. Our next set of specific aims addresses each of these three issues: 1. Are cytoplasmic enzymes shielded from H202 that is generated by periplasmic enzymes? Is intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species especially rapid inside aerated anaerobes? Are these species the primary factor in blocking their aerobic growth? Do antibiotics actually trigger H202 stress? 2. Does superoxide damage mononuclear iron enzymes ? Do oxidants inhibit ferrochelatase? What other targets of these oxidants can we discover through transcriptome analysis? 3. How completely can manganese-fed E. coli dispense with iron? How efficiently is manganese delivered to metalloenzymes? Do lactic-acid bacteria that routinely experience H202 stress employ manganese, rather than iron, in mononuclear non-redox enzymes? What about obligate aerobes, such as eukaryotes? These questions follow directly from the results of the current project. They are fundamental to our understanding of oxidative stress in contexts of medical interest, including the pathogenicity of obligate anaerobes, the effectiveness of antibiotic and antitumor treatments, and the mechanisms by which phagocytes suppress microbial infections."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this field is to attain a complete molecular and physiological understanding of intracellular oxidative stress. Workers seek to determine how reactive oxygen species are formed inside cells, which biomolecules they most rapidly damage, and how cells defend themselves against them. These problems may be most tractable in Escherichia coli. This model organism provides unique advantages for these studies, including the ability to generate hypersensitive mutants in the absence of oxygen. A mutant strain that cannot scavenge hydrogen peroxide has pushed work forward on several fronts. Because it releases endogenous H2O2 into the growth medium, one can quantify the rate at which H2O2 is generated inside aerobic cells. One can also easily impose low doses of H2O2 for an extended period of time, an approach that has revealed the cellular processes that are most sensitive to impairment by H2O2. Finally, by knocking out candidate genes, one can identify those that are critical in defending E. coli against micromolar H2O2 stress. In this application we propose to extend these studies by pursuing four aims: (1) To pinpoint the redox enzymes that most rapidly generate H2O2 inside E. coli. (2) To reveal the mechanism by which H2O2 and superoxide inactivate transketolase, which appears to be extremely vulnerable to inactivation. (3) To investigate how intracellular manganese protects E. coli against H2O2 stress. (4) To identify mechanisms that protect iron-sulfur enzymes from oxidants. Most aspects of the biochemistry of oxidative stress are conserved among all organisms. Most defensive strategies are widely distributed, too. Therefore, this investigation should shed light upon the molecular bases of obligate anaerobiosis, the killing mechanisms of phagocytes, and the nature and severity of endogenous oxidative stress."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A goal of our field is to develop a complete molecular and physiological model of intracellular oxidative stress. We want to know how superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are formed inside cells, which biomolecules they damage, and the strategies by which cells defend themselves against them. We are currently trying to solve these problems in Escherichia coli. This model organism provides unique experimental advantages, including the ability to generate and culture defenseless mutants in the absence of oxygen. In the past 15 years enormous strides were made in understanding superoxide stress, largely from the analysis of an E. coli mutant that lacked superoxide dismutase. We have recently generated an analogous strain that cannot scavenge hydrogen peroxide. This mutant has allowed us to quantify the rate of intracellular H202 formation and to detect the growth and survival defects that this H202 causes. In this application we propose to exploit this and other mutants, as well as a battery of experimental methodologies that were developed for E. coli, in order to nail down the details of oxidative stress mechanisms and defenses. (1) We will pinpoint the sites at which H202 is formed in the cytosol and 02- is formed in the eriplasm of intact, aerobic cells.(2) We will determine the mechanisms by which H202 inhibits biosynthesis in log-phase cells and kills early-stationary-phase cells.(3) We will identify mechanisms by which Dps protects DNA and an undefined factor protects the iron-sulfur cluster of aconitase A. We believe that knowledge of oxidative damage and defense in E. coli will provide a blueprint for efforts to solve key issues in oxidative stress: obligate anaerobiosis, the killing mechanism of) hagocytes, and endogenous oxidative stress in higher organisms."
"Oxidative stress has been linked to a variety of human pathologies. It is also critical to bacterial pathogenesis, both because oxygen limits the virulence of microaerophiles and because macrophages use oxidants to attack bacterial invaders. Therefore it is important to achieve a molecular understanding to the mechanisms by which oxygen species damage cells and to the tactics that cells employ to defend themselves. The long-term goal of our lab is to resolve these issues using model bacteria as study subjects. Our current aims are: (1) To explore the molecular basis of the oxygen intolerance of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Preliminary data suggest that B. theta is consigned to anaerobiosis in part because its fumarase, a key iron- sulfur dehydratase, loses activity in air. If this idea is confirmed, then a second problem will be explored: Why does air inactivate such iron-sulfur clusters in B. theta but not in E. coli? (2) To explain unsolved phenotypes of superoxide dismutase-deficient E. coli. SOD mutants cannot synthesize branched-chain amino acids or catabolize non-fermentable carbon sources, and they suffer rapid mutagenesis. These traits have been clearly explained by iron-sulfur cluster damaged. However, these mutants also require reduced sulfur and aromatic amino acids. Circumstantial evidence suggests that these phenotypes, too, evolve from cluster damage. (3) To explain why E. coli synthesizes two aconitases. During oxidative stress E. Coli induces a superoxide-resistant isozyme to replace the labile one. This begs the question: Why maintain a labile isozyme at all? One answer may be trivial--that the primary aconitase is kinetically superior--but a more interesting possibility is that the inactivation of the major aconitase is beneficial during periods of iron starvation. (4) To uncover the mechanisms by which the SoxRS regulon defends oxidatively stressed cells. The SoxRS regulon induces several enzymes that provide obvious benefits to superoxide-stressed cells, but the purposes of others are more obscure. It is plausible that some of the latter enzymes help to repair damaged iron-sulfur clusters. Other, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases, may be understandable only if some of the toxicity of these drugs arises from NADPH depletion rather than from reactive oxygen species."
"The goal of this project is to determine the mechanism(s) and physiological impact of endogenous superoxide production in Escherichia coli. Strains that lack superoxide dismutase exhibit severe aerobic growth deficiencies, indicating that superoxide is made intracellularly during aerobiosis. Our studies have indicated that superoxide is formed primarily by autoxidation of components of the respiratory chain, including fumarate reductase. We now propose: (1) to identify the other sites of respiratory superoxide production; (2) to determine how the electronic structure of fumarate reductase singularly predisposes it to generate superoxide; (3) to establish whether the superoxide flux from respiratory sources is large enough to damage SOD-proficient cells; and (4) to determine whether superoxide production by low-potential anaerobic respiratory chains causes acute oxidative stress when this facultative anaerobe enters an aerobic environment. For years workers have imposed artificial stresses upon E. coli in order to characterize its elaborate network of oxidative defenses. We want to identify the endogenous sources of the oxidants against which E. coli has evolved to defend itself. More generally, this investigation will identify the characteristics that predispose electron carriers to generate superoxide. Such information may assist in identifying similar sources of superoxide in mammalian cells. Recent work indicates that endogenous superoxide causes the familial form of the neurological disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Circumstantial evidence has suggested that superoxide may also have a role in the initiation or progression of other clinical disorders, including heart disease and cancer."

"The hypothesis that endogenous oxidants continually batter the DNA of aerobic cells has gained widespread acceptance. It is considered plausible that the resultant damage is the root cause of spontaneous mutagenesis and aging. It is therefore desirable to define details of the mechanism of damage as it actually occurs inside the cell. The long-standing model had proposed that superoxide (O2-) was the source of the electrons that drive the formation of hydroxyl radicals from H2O2. Free iron would catalyze the reaction. However, studies in E. coli have shown that another, unknown reductant is the electron donor, while O2-actually provides the catalytic iron by destroying labile enzymic [4Fe-4S] clusters. Our aims are: (1) To identify the dehydratases in E. coli from which superoxide (O2-) releases the iron. The rate of DNA damage in a O2-stressed cell may depend upon the abundance of such enzymes. (2) To determine whether O2- has the same effect upon iron pools and DNA damage in eukaryotes. A particularly interesting question is whether the nuclear DNA, but not the mitochondrial DNA, is protected by its compartmentalization away from O2- sources and labile enzymes. (3) To identify the unknown reductant that controls the rate of oxidative DNA damage in E. coli. We have designed genetic and biochemical experiments to test the hypothesis that the reductant is NADH. (4) To establish whether nitric oxide accelerates DNA damage by inhibiting respiration. Known respiratory blocks accelerate damage, probably by forcing the accumulation of the reductant. (5) To quantify the fraction of replication-blocking lesions and 'spontaneous' that are due to endogenous oxidants. This aim will require the adaptation of quantitative PCR analyses. Our long-term goal is to establish both the mechanism and impact of DNA damage by endogenous oxidants. Further, by understanding how metabolic perturbations affect DNA oxidation, we may be able to anticipate the affects of drug therapies upon mutagenesis and cell death."
"Summary. Oxidative stress has been implicated in a wide range of human pathologies, and it is also determinativein the ecology of microbial communities and the microbicidal actions of the cell-based immune system.However, its molecular nature is incompletely understood. In discussions of oxidative stress, the presence ofreactive oxygen species (ROS) is often conflated with the accumulation of protein disulfide bonds. The modelbacterium Escherichia coli provides circumstantial evidence to support this view. E. coli responds to H2O2exposure by inducing several redoxins devoted to the reduction of disulfide bonds, and its growth duringsuperoxide stress is possible only if a rapidly imported cysteine precursor is provided. Yet we and others haveshown that the primary ROS?superoxide and hydrogen peroxide?do not oxidize typical cysteine residues atan impactful rate. In this proposal we seek to identify the connection between the presence of these oxidantsand the disruption of cellular thiol status. We have begun by delineating the processes that control theintracellular level of cysteine. We have already identified the routes and extremely high rate of cystine entryinto E. coli, and in Aim 1 we propose to do the same for cysteine. We will then examine the devices that helpto curb cysteine over-accumulation: its efflux via AlaE, and its degradation by YhaM. This approach providesnecessary context for interpreting the effects of cysteine supplementation upon the phenotypes of oxidativestress. In Aim 2 we seek to identify the major mechanisms by which oxidative stress can generate disulfidebonds. We will test three widely suspected sources of general disulfide-bond formation: iron-catalyzed thioloxidation, copper-catalyzed thiol oxidation, and the inadvertent dissemination of disulfide bonds by the primaryperoxidase, AhpCF. We will then examine site-specific thiol oxidation that we have observed when H2O2attacks iron-based enzymes. In particular, we will test whether the induction of redoxins is an important step inthe repair of these enzymes. In Aim 3, we seek to explain why superoxide-stressed cells can only grow if theycontain high levels of cysteine. Superoxide disrupts enzymic iron-sulfur clusters and triggers themismetallation of mononuclear iron enzymes. We have shown that the slow step in cluster repair is thedelivery of iron, and our recent work suggests that intracellular cysteine mobilizes iron to the enzymes thatneed it. Further, cysteine is uniquely effective at extracting zinc from mismetallated iron enzymes, which is therate-limiting step in their repair. Thus our analysis of superoxide stress has revealed opportunities for cysteineto restore the functions of pathways that superoxide otherwise blocks. In aggregate, the successful completionof these aims will reveal how thiol status is connected to oxidative stress. This would fill a large, perplexinghole in our view of how oxidants damage cells and how cells defend themselves against them. It will alsofinally provide a rational framework for considering the use of thiol antioxidants to diagnose or suppressoxidative stress. "
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of this study are to investigate the mechanisms by which soft metals, cystine import, and cysteine accumulation can perturb the fitness of Escherichia coli. These three distinct stresses are connected by the central involvement of cysteine chemistry. Soft metals are present in many habitats, where they comprise a threat to bacteria and higher organisms alike. Their toxicity is underscored by the distribution throughout the biota of dedicated detoxification systems that bind and export them. Some of these metals- notably silver and mercury-have a long history of being used as antibiotics. Nevertheless, we have little knowledge of how they actually damage cells. In recent published work we demonstrated that copper poisons E. coli primarily by inactivating Fe/S-dependent dehydratases. It does so by binding the cysteine residues that coordinate the catalytic iron-sulfur clusters of these enzymes, thereby displacing the iron atoms. Preliminary data demonstrate that silver, mercury, cadmium, and zinc have this effect in vitro, too. This study (Aim 1) will test whether these soft metals exert their toxicity through this mechanism in vivo. It will also determine whether soft metals similarly displace iron from mononuclear enzymes, which employ coordinating groups-often including cysteine-that prefer metals other than iron. Aim 2 focuses upon a separate sulfur problem: the risk of disulfide stress when cystine is imported from aerobic environments. Disulfide stress has conventionally been thought to arise from reactive oxygen species, but recent data do not support this idea. However, disulfide stress is a real risk when cells rapidly import disulfide compounds, such as cystine. In principle such an event would seem likely to propagate disulfide bonds to cytoplasmic proteins. Our study of the high-flux transporter suggests that cystine import is linked to reduction, a tacti that would avoid the release of this disulfide into the cytoplasm. In Aim 2 this model will be rigorously tested. Aim 3 addresses the consequence of rapid cystine import: the excessive accumulation of cysteine, which is toxic in its own right. Our data reveals that E. coli deals withthis problem by pumping the cysteine back out of the cell. This investigation will test three plausible mechanisms of cysteine toxicity, and it will identify the exporter(s) that averts it. Collectively this work will illuminate chemical problems that arise from the redox activity and metal affinity of cysteine, as well as the strategies that cells have acquired to protect themselve from it. All three of these sulfur-focused stresses-soft-metal exposure, disulfide import, and cysteine accumulation-occur under conditions that are likely to exist in natural habitats."

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The bacteriocidal actions of soft metals have long been exploited, from the administration of mercury as an antibiotic to the coating of catheters with silver. This study seeks to illuminate how these metals exert their effects-which may enable workers to refine how they are employed. We also will examine how E. coli strives to minimize the intracellular concentrations of both disulfide and free-cysteine species. The loss of this control comprises a type of oxidative stress that is believed to contribute to a wide variety of human pathologies."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The conference will highlight the growing utility of swine models in biomedical research. In the toolbox category, genomic and tissue microarrays are just beginning to be appreciated for use in animal models. As porcine-specific genomic information becomes increasingly available, characterization and adoption of pigs as human models in many disease categories will accelerate. In the applications category, there is still much to explore beyond the pig's already proven value in immunology, nutrition, transplantation, cardiovascular disease, orthopedics, and dermatology/wound healing. In addition, initiatives are warranted in new zoonotic diseases, biodefense, behavior/neurological imaging, and gnotobiology. The pig genome is also being sequenced and will provide sequence information that can be used to construct relevant models. Capturing sequence information to create appropriate models to study pathogenesis, new means of diagnosing and treating life style-related diseases are now a reality with the pig. The increasing shortage of donor organs for transplantation has lead to a search for suitable xenograft organs. Pigs are now considered the primary candidate donor animal. The ability to genetically modify and clone pigs provides a unique opportunity to further exploit this model not only for understanding the mechanisms of graft rejection but to create clinical therapies. The conference goals are to identify areas of study or methodologies that will enhance the utility of pigs as biomedical models. In particular, the conference will focus on identifying appropriate human diseases where traditional rodent models have not proven relevant, where the historical use of swine in this regard may be enhanced, or where no useful models exist today and for which swine may be considered. The conference will identify resource needs and areas in which new approaches or methodologies are required. The conference also will serve to stimulate interactions between researchers working within swine and human genomics and identify needs and opportunities to fully exploit this animal model."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Swine in Biomedical Research Conference 2011 will highlight the growing utility of swine models in biomedical research. In the toolbox category, genomic and tissue microarrays and next generation sequencing are just beginning to be appreciated. In the applications category, there is still much to explore beyond the pig's already proven value in immunology, nutrition, transplantation, cardiovascular disease, and orthopedics. New initiatives are warranted in zoonotic diseases, cognitive behavior, bioengineering and regenerative medicine. The pig genome has been completed and sequence information can be used to construct models to development new means of diagnosing and treating life style-related diseases. The ability to genetically modify and clone pigs further enhances the value of the pig for dissecting disease mechanisms and validating clinical therapies. Recent workshops have focused on utilizing animal sciences expertise traditionally supported by the USDA can support of NIH funded investigators that utilizing pig models. These joint USDA and NIH discussions identified cultural differences and the lack of in depth knowledge of needs and opportunities as major rate limiting issues. Hence, this conference has been organized to directly address these acknowledged limitations. First, the Organizing Committee has selected individuals whose research has successfully transcended both health and animal science cultures. Second, the invited speakers will showcase investigations using the pig that demonstrate successful applications as well as promising areas that require engagement across the proposed cultural divide. Finally, we will invite USDA and NIH representations to lead discussions on integrating respective strengths into addressing critical biomedical research issues. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): The Swine in Biomedical Research Conference 2011 represents the fourth in a series of timely conferences that have highlighted the utility of porcine models in biomedical research. The emergence of genetic information and the technologies to target manipulations combined with the ability to clone pigs provides the ability to create highly relevant animal model. This conference will build upon the considerable energy within the biomedical community with respect to the utilization of pigs."
