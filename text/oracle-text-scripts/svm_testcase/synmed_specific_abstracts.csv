"Project AbstractThe goal of this R21 proposal is to develop a robust, minimally invasive wireless photometrysystem for in vivo calcium measures in freely moving behavior. To achieve this, a miniaturized,wireless, `injectable' photometry platform (~300 mm wide, ~100 mm thick and several mm long)that enables quantitative measurements of fluorescence stimulated using a high performancemicroscale inorganic light emitting diode (µ-ILED) and captured using a co-located, sensitivemicroscale inorganic photodetector (µ-IPD) is proposed. These devices directly address currentlimitations in measuring calcium transient activity within any environment and facilitate sensingof genetically defined neural networks in more ethologically relevant behaviors -- central goal ofthe BRAIN initiative and RFA-EY-16-001. These small-scale device components will mount onthin, flexible filaments with overall dimensions significantly smaller than fiber optic cables. Theresulting systems will greatly reduce motion artifacts, due to their direct integration at targetedregions of the brain; when implemented using wireless schemes for power delivery and datacommunication, they will allow complete freedom of motion of awake, behaving animals,suitable for use in complex, three dimensional environments and in socially interactingcommunities. Preliminary data from using hard-wired versions of these technologies andseparate demonstrations of wireless implantable platforms establish feasibility of thefoundational concepts. This proposal is divided into following two aims:Specific Aim 1: To examine brain activity in real-time on awake, behaving animals using a platformof injectable µ-ILEDs and µ-IPDs, with a test case measuring the fear conditioning responses.The thin, flexible, lithographically defined photometry probes will be insert into targeted regions ofthe deep brain, such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA), including lateral, basal, and accessorybasal nuclei using stereotactic positioning hardware and surgical procedures adopted from thoseused in previous wireless, injectable systems for optogenetics.Specific Aim 2: To develop wireless schemes for power delivery and data communication forthese systems, with demonstrations in fear conditioning and social interaction. Further sizereductions and purely wireless modes of operation will greatly enhance the technology and theopportunities in neuroscience studies. Behavior experiments including fear conditioning (outlinedin Aim 1) and social interaction (known to evoke BLA activity) will serve to demonstrate andoptimize the fully wireless capabilities."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this proposal we describe a novel label-free assay that can be used to rapidly screen protein-small molecule interactions that are not easily screened by any other method. The label-free assay is based upon an optical biosensor technology called a 'photonic crystal' structure that is inexpensively manufactured from continuous sheets of plastic film and incorporated into standard 96- and 384-well plates. By eliminating the need for a label, the assay is less susceptible to errors and artifacts caused by conformational change or blocking of active binding epitopes. Once fully developed, it is envisioned that the technology will be used in the context of a primary screen of a chemical library and/or as a secondary screen for measuring dose- response characteristics of a protein-small molecule combination. The proposed project develops a new type of label-free assay, called the 'Spot Protocol,' in which the volume of target protein required is &lt;0.1 mu l/well, and error sources due to bulk refractive index variability and nonspecific binding are automatically eliminated. The new assay utilizes an image-based method to enable high sensitivity detection of small- molecule binding signals, but incorporates a novel image-processing algorithm to provide a simple numerical output that is a direct measurement of the binding interaction between protein and analyte. The successful completion of the proposed work would represent the first application of the photonic crystal assay technology to a high-throughput screening (HTS) application. By focusing the initial demonstrations on proteins that do not function as enzymes and are thus difficult to target through more standard HTS processes, the benefits of this technology towards the targeting of proteins traditionally viewed as 'nondrugable' will be obvious. Thus, our goal is to develop this assay technology to the point where any researcher could use this label-free detection method to identify a small molecule ligand to a protein of interest, even if that protein in not an enzyme and thus has no conveniently-monitored activity-based readout. To make the community aware of the potential of such a method and thus facilitate its transfer into other laboratories, we have targeted proteins in the apoptotic pathway. By focusing on biochemical pathways that regulate apoptosis, the proposed project aims to make an impact on understanding the fundamental processes involved in programmed cell death, and on how misregulation of such processes are result in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The selection and identification of chemical compounds with the ability to selectively induce apoptosis of cancer cells, or to prevent apoptosis of healthy cells is one key to the development of new drug therapies for many diseases."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a clinical need for rapid, multiplexed, and cost-effective detection of soluble protein-based cancer biomarkers. Photonic crystal (PC) surfaces have been recently demonstrated as an effective approach for increasing the output and collection efficiency of fluorescent dyes that are used for protein microarray biomarker detection. Using a quantitative sandwich fluorescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format, the combined effects of PC- enhanced fluorophore excitation and PC-enhanced extraction have been used to reduce the limits of detection of breast cancer biomarkers in plasma, compared to performing the same assay on an ordinary glass surface, resulting in the ability to detect biomarkers in the 0.1 - 10 pg/ml concentration range, as is required for low abundance proteins. In the proposed project, we will develop several innovative approaches for the instrument design that will further reduce the limits of detection for PC-based fluorescent ELISA assays, while integrating the PC into a microfluidic format that will minimize assay volume and allow the assay process to be performed on a droplet of plasma. The PC will be fabricated from low autofluorescence silicon materials, with a design that enables a high quality-factor resonant optical mode to simultaneously provide enhanced excitation and enhanced extraction of fluorescence. The detection instrument will utilize a novel laser scanning approach that optimally couples laser illumination into the PC and matches the resonant coupling condition. The proposed effort seeks to translate photonic crystal enhanced fluorescence (PCEF) technology developed to the proof-of-principle stage under previous NIH funding towards clinical applications. In our previous work, PC device structures, fabrication methods, and detection instruments were developed and first demonstrated for DNA microarrays and protein microarrays. While detection of a panel of breast cancer biomarkers will be evaluated in the proposed project, the detection platform can be applied to multiplexed arrays of biomarker assays for other cancers and diseases. To validate the new sensor and detection instrument, we will detect biomarkers spiked into plasma to establish calibration standards, directly compare against conventional ELISAs, and subsequently quantify biomarker concentrations in blood from breast cancer patients with known Her2 and estrogen receptor statuses. A suite of bioinformatics tools will be modified for automated data analysis and interpretation. The overall goal is to develop a highly sensitive, multiplexed, rapid, and automated assay platform for fluorescent microarray ELISA that can perform biomarker analysis on a droplet of plasma."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal describes the initial development of a fundamentally new type of optical biosensor that utilizes active generation of light output with a plastic-based laser surface structure to provide high resolution label-free sensing of biomolecular interactions. While the laser biosensor can be produced inexpensively over large surface areas by a replica molding process, the detection instrument that we propose building will be compact, inexpensive, and capable of resolution sufficient for direct detection of small molecule binding to immobilized protein targets with high signal-to-noise ratio. The first funded effort, proposed here, would enable development of the sensor fabrication process, construction of a detection instrument, and performance of a set of initial feasibility studies for small molecule direct binding assays. Our long-term goal is to develop this biosensor method into a general-purpose detection platform for small molecule screening, cell-based assays, biomarker diagnostics, and environmental detection by taking advantage of its potential for imaging detection and single protein molecule detection resolution. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project is aimed at the development of a high resolution biomolecular interaction detection technology that can be utilized to address the large swath of the proteome consisting of proteins that have no enzymatic function and are hence not 'screenable' using conventional technologies. Proteins that modulate transcription, those that receive signals from the cellular surface, and those that are involved in DNA damage repair are among the thousands of proteins that do not have enzymatic activity but whose modulation with drugs could lead to treatments for a host of diseases. The stagnation in the number of new protein targets underscores the need for new technologies for high-throughput screening: in the years from 1989-2000, only 6% of the new molecular entities hit previously undrugged targets. Thus, to get at new targets and identify new compounds that are true breakthroughs in disease treatment, we need detection methodologies that can be utilized to rapidly identify small molecule binders for proteins, not merely enzymatic inhibitors."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA microarrays are capable of simultaneously evaluating the relative expression levels of thousands of genes, and have developed rapidly since their initial introduction. As a result, DNA microarrays are now one of the most preferred technologies for identifying early biomarkers of toxicity and disease. The outcome of microarray studies can be affected by many technical and instrumental factors, resulting in major criticism regarding lack of reproducibility and accuracy of the derived data. Although fluorescent dyes, surface chemistries, spotting robots, hybridization chambers, detection instruments, and data analysis tools have all undergone substantial development and refinement, the microarray substrate itself remains as a simple glass surface. In this proposal, we describe how replacement of the glass surface with a special-purpose optical transducer can provide quality control information on the interspot and intraspot density of microarray spots that is currently completely lacking from microarray analysis, while simultaneously amplifying the intensity of fluorescent labels used to quantify hybridized DNA. By providing information on spot variability, (representing a major source of error in microarray analysis), while at the same time increasing the signal-to-noise ratio for detection of weakly expressed genes (where microarray platforms currently face a disadvantage compared to other quantitative gene expression platforms), the proposed project represents a fundamental advance in microarray technology. The optical transducer used to provide these features is a 2-dimensional photonic crystal (PC) surface that is designed to provide optical resonances that enable high resolution label-free imaging detection of deposited microarray spots and up to 550x enhanced detection sensitivity of commonly used microarray fluorescent dyes. The PC is fabricated by a large-area nanoreplica molding process on plastic substrates that are attached to standard glass microscope slides for compatibility with existing spotting robots, hybridization chambers, and detection instruments. Recently, large area PC surfaces have been developed by the Cunningham Group at Illinois as multifunctional optical transducers that can be designed to produce narrow-wavelength electromagnetic resonances at any desired wavelength, featuring high intensity fields that extend evanescently into the media on the PC surface. The interaction of the optical resonance with adsorbed biomolecules results in a highly localized shift of the resonant wavelength that is used to quantify the density of adsorbed material without the use of fluorescent labels, enabling label-free images of deposited DNA microarray spots to be measured with 4 5m spatial resolution over a PC comprising the entire surface of a conventional microarray slide. A PC surface may also be designed so that the optical resonance coincides with the wavelength of a laser used to excite a fluorescent dye, thereby increasing the fluorescent output intensity relative to the intensity that would occur on an ordinary glass microarray slide, using an effect called Enhanced Fluorescence (EF). The EF effect has been shown to result in ~50x increase in the detected fluorescence signal using commercially available microarray laser scanning instruments, but can be further enhanced when the PC is designed to also incorporate an optical resonance at the emission wavelength of the fluorophore, resulting in an additional 10x gain in sensitivity. In the proposed effort, we plan for the first time to apply 2-dimensional PC surfaces that incorporate optical resonances for both label-free detection and EF to spotted gene expression microarrays. The label-free resonance will be utilized to quantify the density variability of deposited DNA spots, thereby providing a quality- control tool that is not currently available to researchers using spotted arrays. The label-free images of DNA spots will be used to quantify interspot and intraspot density variability, providing information that will be used to eliminate defective spots from further analysis or as a means for normalizing the detected signal from subsequent fluorescent measurements. The EF resonance will be applied to enhance the output of Cy5- labeled hybridized DNA, enabling gene expression analysis to be conducted with lower sample concentrations and the ability to observe gene expression at lower levels than has previously been possible. The project will enable collaboration between faculty in Electrical Engineering, who developed the PC and EF technology under NSF funding, and faculty in Crop Science, who manage the NSF Soybean Functional Genomics Center, thus allowing the technology to be fully tested and developed for large arrays. The benefits of the method will be statistically quantified on a 7680-element gene array with sufficient inter-chip and intra- chip replicates and controls to quantify sensitivity and quality control gains obtained from each independent PC transducer function. The resulting capability will be broadly applicable across a wide range of scientific research that utilizes microarrays for human, animal, and plant gene expression analysis. Analysis of soybean gene arrays was selected as an ideal testbed for the new sensor technology, as it will not require the safety and approval protocols for working with human DNA and human-derived test samples."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revision application is submitted in response to Notice Number NOT-OD-09-058 (Notice Title: NIH Announces the availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications). The revision application adds two new Specific Aims to a previously funded R01 application for Funding Opportunity PAR 07 070, entitled 'Photonic Crystal Surfaces for Label-Free Detection and Fluorescence Amplification: Application to DNA Microarrays,' by B.T. Cunningham, L. Vodkin, and G. Bollero. The original grant (PHS 1R01 GM086382) includes funding for 1/1/09 through 12/31/12. The revision adds a new PI to the project - Dr. Richard Zangar from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to include nationally recognized expertise in protein microarrays. DNA and protein microarrays are capable of simultaneously evaluating the relative expression levels of thousands of genes or dozens of cancer biomarkers, and have developed rapidly since their initial introduction. As a result, microarrays are now one of the most preferred technologies for identifying early genetic or expressed protein biomarkers of toxicity and disease.

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The modern drug discovery industry has evolved over the last ~120 years, largely influenced by Emil Fischer's enunciation of the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis for enzymes and inhibitors in 1890 and Paul Ehrich's 'magic bullet' hypothesis for selective pharmaceutical agents. Today, small molecule inhibition of enzymes and receptor agonism/antagonism remain mainstays of drug development strategies. However, there is an emerging recognition that one needs to move beyond enzymes and receptors for the development of drugs, especially for the treatment of diseases for which there are no cures. All biological pathways rely on protein- DNA and protein-protein interactions, thus making them prime targets for disruption with small molecules in disease treatment. Unfortunately, while enzyme inhibitors can be readily discovered through in vitro assays using chromogenic/fluorescent readouts, protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions are much more difficult to detect. This lack of general and convenient assays has been a major reason that more compounds have not been developed for these targets. In the previous 3-year funding period, (at the time of this writing, we have just completed Year 2) we developed a novel technology based on Photonic Crystal (PC) biosensors to detect protein-DNA interactions. In this renewal, we will build off this success and extend this technology, apply it to protein-protein interactions, and utilize it to discover and validate compounds that inhibit the AIF- DNA interaction and the cytochrome c-Apaf-1 interaction. The specific aims of the proposed project are designed to further the development of PC biosensor technology as a general purpose pharmaceutical screening tool, and to thereby broaden the range of biologically significant applications that it can address. To do so, our goal is to utilize the ability of the PC biosensor format to provide high resolution spatial images of biochemical and cell binding to their surface, and to develop a new 'self-referencing' microplate format that will enable direct measurement of small molecule- protein interactions in a high-throughput manner. Our goal is to demonstrate these capabilities by continuing to focus on assays that are relevant to the apoptosis pathway. Specifically, we are using PC biosensors to identify small molecules that disrupt the Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF)-DNA interaction, and the cytochrome c-Apaf-1 interaction, biological binding events of high medicinal relevance but that are not amenable to standard high-throughput screening (HTS) methods. Compounds obtained through these PC biosensor screens will be evaluated in a series of tiered in vitro and cell based assays. Through execution of the program objectives, the proposed effort will develop, demonstrate, and validate the PC technology for a broad range of the assays used in small molecule drug discovery (i.e. inhibition assays, direct binding assays, primary screening, secondary screening, and cell-based validation) while focusing on an application with a high degree of fundamental relevance to human health. Our goal is to use these compounds to validate the AIF-DNA and cytochrome c-Apaf-1 interactions as tractable targets for the treatment of diseases of premature cell death, such as Parkinson's Disease. The long-term impact of this work will be the development and wide dissemination of highly sensitive, high throughput label-free assay methods that can be broadly applied throughout drug discovery, and the development of compounds and validation of therapeutic targets for the treatment for a Parkinson's Disease, a devastating illness that currently afflicts >1% of the 65-and-older population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The specific aims of the proposed project are designed to further the development of Photonic Crystal (PC) biosensor technology as a general purpose pharmaceutical screening tool, and to thereby broaden the range of biologically significant applications that they can address. One of the main goals is to develop the capability of PC biosensors as a robust screen for small molecule binding to immobilized protein targets through a 'triple referencing' method within 1536-well biosensor microplates, and the use of a dielectric nanorod surface to enhance small molecule binding signals. Our goal is also to extend the capabilities of PC biosensor-based screening to include inhibitors and enhancers of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, by continuing to focus on assays that are relevant to the apoptosis pathway. Specifically, we are using PC biosensors to identify small molecules that disrupt the Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF)-DNA interaction, a biological interaction of high medicinal relevance but one that is not amenable to standard HTS methods. Compounds obtained through this PC biosensor screen will be validated and evaluated in a series of tiered in vitro and cell based assays."
"Routine high-sensitivity multiplexed detection of disease biomarkers in blood will have an impact onearly diagnosis and therapy selection. A novel and highly effective approach for detection of broad categoriesof disease is multiplexed detection of antibodies using protein microarrays. As a greater number of antibodybiomarkers are being identified and clinically validated for viral infection, cancer, cardiovascular disease, andautoimmune disease, there is a strong need to detect them with greater sensitivity and greater signal-to-noiseratio, while at the same time being able to perform automated biomarker analysis with low cost per test. In theproposed project, the investigators integrate photonic crystal enhanced fluorescence (PCEF) technology with anovel size-exclusion blood filtration technology to develop a multiplexed microspot fluorescent sandwich assayplatform for the clinical laboratory environment. Our approach integrates several innovations into aninexpensive plastic-based sensor cartridge and desktop detection instrument: 1. A silicon-basednanostructured resonant optical photonic crystal chip with an integrated Fabry-Perot optical cavity will be usedto deliver ~50x greater signal enhancement than current-generation PCEF devices, which already routinelyprovide &lt;1 pg/ml limits of detection in complex media, using only 10 ?l sample volumes. 2. A laser-machinedblood filter will separate plasma from a droplet of heparinized whole blood in 60 seconds, enabling the entireassay protocol to be performed automatically in &lt;60 minutes without user intervention. 3. An innovative laserscanning approach is used to couple light from a small semiconductor laser directed to the PC surface in theoptimal ?on-resonance? condition, resulting in a rugged, compact instrument with a cost of &lt;$10K. 4. Astatistical bioinformatics tool indicating the presence or absence of the biomarkers in the test sample. As anexample application of the system, we will focus our effort on detection of a panel of 3 serum antibodies forhuman papillomavirus (HPV) as a means for identifying patients with greater susceptibility to oropharyngealcarcinoma (OPC), although the same technology can be extended to detection of broad classes of antibodybiomarkers. The new instrument will be first tested upon biomarkers spiked into whole blood, with resultscompared against single-antibody ELISA in microplates and the Luminex bead-based system. Furthervalidation and comparison will be performed upon clinical blood samples from patients with known HPVexposure. Our long-term goal is to demonstrate a prototype system that can be applied broadly for multiplexedserum antibody biomarker analysis."
"Alcohol?s ability to improve mood in the face of stress is among its most prized reinforcing properties, long heldby researchers to be of critical importance for the understanding of the etiology of alcohol use disorder (AUD).Drinkers overwhelmingly report that the mood-enhancement they gain from alcohol is most pronounced in thecontext of stress, and individuals who report higher levels of stress relief from alcohol are at risk for developingAUD. But attempts to capture this key element of alcohol reinforcement using experimental methods haveyielded strikingly inconsistent results. One remarkable feature of this prior experimental research is that, inattempting to capture alcohol?s stress-relieving effects, researchers have strayed far outside the range ofstressors typically encountered in typical drinking contexts, contexts that are overwhelmingly social in nature.In the proposed study, we revisit these critical questions using a novel approach, looking to the settings inwhich people actually drink alcohol to identify manipulations capable of capturing alcohol stress-relief. Morespecifically, we explore two of the most fundamental social stressors?lack of social familiarity and poorrelationship quality?as moderators of alcohol reinforcement. We examine whether alcohol is more reinforcingwithin the context of unfamiliar vs. familiar social interaction and, further, whether alcohol is more reinforcingwithin the context of low vs. high quality social relationships. Capturing alcohol?s effects within the context ofnatural social discourse presents formidable methodological challenges, and we bring multiple methods to bearon our questions, combining experimental and ambulatory methods and employing state-of-the-sciencemeasures of emotion and alcohol consumption. We examine our study aims in a sample of individuals withhigh relevance for the understanding of AUD etiology?young heavy social drinkers. In the laboratory arm ofthe study, 360 individuals will be randomly assigned to consume either a moderate dose of alcohol or a controlbeverage in the company of either familiar or unfamiliar individuals. Of these individuals, 180 will alsoparticipate in a 21-day ambulatory assessment period to examine the interaction of alcohol and social stress indaily life. In the ambulatory study arm, participants will wear transdermal ankle bracelets to assess BAC(calibrated for each individual within the laboratory session) and will further provide information about theirmood and their social contexts in response to random prompts. The Facial Action Coding System, acomprehensive, anatomically-based system for categorizing facial muscle movement, will be employed toassess emotion in both laboratory and ambulatory arms of the study. The proposed research contributes to theunderstanding of AUD by addressing one of the most fundamental questions in the alcohol literature?thequestion of why people drink. In addition, by looking to ?real life? to identify stressors, the proposed studymight have a variety of key implications for AUD etiology and interventions, including for harm-reduction andprevention programs, reducing rates of relapse, and the identification of those at risk for AUD."
"? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ghana has a population of 23.5 million people, of which 3.5 million adults are hypertensive. Furthermore, the country's physician-to-population ratio is 1:13,000 nationally. Given such limited resources, cost-effective systems-level strategiesare urgently needed to mitigate the rising epidemic of hypertension in countries like Ghana. One such approach is task- shifting, defined as the rational distribution of primary care duties from physicians to non-physician healthcare providers. A cluster-randomized trial of task-shifting and blood pressure control in community health centers (CHCs), district hospitals and with community health nurses (CHN) is currently on-going in Ghana. While the proposed intervention will tell us whether implementation of the task-shifting strategy results in blood pressure reduction and maintenance at the individual level, at present, very little is known about stakeholder perceptions of the intervention itself, or the factors and/or context likely to facilitte or limit sustainment of the strategy beyond the implementation period. One method than can address this is group concept-mapping (GCM), a structured mixed-methods approach that considers the perspectives of different stakeholder groups to identify potential barriers and facilitators likely to impact implementation of EBPs in real- world settings [6]. The goal of this study is to use group concept mapping to identify stakeholder (e.g. CHNs, physicians, etc.) perspectives on the barriers and facilitators likely to influence the sustainment of the task-shifting strategy in Ghana. The specific aims are: 1) To identify stakeholder perspectives on the value of and factors likely to facilitate or hinder the sustainment of the WHO PEN model in Ghana; 2) To assess the perceived importance and likelihood that these factors would be sustained over time; and 3) To develop a conceptual framework on sustaining the WHO PEN model in Ghana.

"? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ghana has a population of 23.5 million people, of which 3.5 million adults are hypertensive. Furthermore, the country's physician-to-population ratio is 1:13,000 nationally. Given such limited resources, cost-effective systems-level strategiesare urgently needed to mitigate the rising epidemic of hypertension in countries like Ghana. One such approach is task- shifting, defined as the rational distribution of primary care duties from physicians to non-physician healthcare providers. A cluster-randomized trial of task-shifting and blood pressure control in community health centers (CHCs), district hospitals and with community health nurses (CHN) is currently on-going in Ghana. While the proposed intervention will tell us whether implementation of the task-shifting strategy results in blood pressure reduction and maintenance at the individual level, at present, very little is known about stakeholder perceptions of the intervention itself, or the factors and/or context likely to facilitte or limit sustainment of the strategy beyond the implementation period. One method than can address this is group concept-mapping (GCM), a structured mixed-methods approach that considers the perspectives of different stakeholder groups to identify potential barriers and facilitators likely to impact implementation of EBPs in real- world settings [6].

"? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Engineered nanoparticles are moving toward clinical use as drug delivery, imaging and therapeutic agents. Side effects of nanoparticle interactions with cells, and occasionally organisms, are studied (e.g., toxicity) but the measured outputs are usually blunt (e.g., live/dead assays) and provide little insight into the nanoparticle chemistry and mechanisms that trigger inflammation and tissue damage. Moreover, many in vitro tests are based on acute nanoparticle exposure to cell monocultures, whereas effects on tissue physiology may only appear after chronic exposure. An alternative is to use animal models, but the outcomes of such studies have not provided sufficient mechanistic insight to justify the expense and ethical challenges of extensive animal testing. Increasingly sophisticated cell culture experiments allow for better prediction of in vivo responses to agents. The most likely point of entry of nanoparticulates to humans is the lung. Beyond the use of primary cell cultures, adding mechanical stretch, an air-water interface, and fluid flow to standard cell conditions far better approximates the physiological environment within the lung. In addition, dynamic imaging capabilities with protein-based fluorescent reporters enable the real time monitoring of signaling and altered tissue phenotype in situ, without the need for fixation. The goal of this work is to combine these advances to measure the response of pulmonary cell arrays to a suite of nanoparticles of well-defined size, shape, and surface chemistry upon mechanical stretch and flow conditions for both acute and chronic time scales. Disease progression (inflammation) will be monitored on chip, by focusing on inflammatory signatures including reactive oxygen species and cytokine production, cytoskeletal remodeling, and compromised intercellular barrier integrity. The surface chemistry of the nanoparticles will be modified to be anti-biofouling, to tet the hypothesis that surface chemical modification of nanoparticles can mitigate adverse impacts. Overall, this methodology might lead to more realistic organ-on-a-chip models without the use of animals to predict emerging contaminant impact."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The architectural and functional group complexity of natural products often confers to them unique modes of biological activity and significant therapeutic value. Despite transformative advances in catalytic methods and strategies for constructing highly complex molecules, the practice of total synthesis still remains a laborious and time intensive pursuit. Consequently, such compounds are rarely sought or evaluated as potential therapeutics. Historically, the development of new synthetic methods has had a profound impact on the efficiency of complex molecule synthesis. New reaction classes that lead to fundamentally novel reactivity stand to promote the largest advances in this regard. As a guide, we can look towards Nature�s synthetic strategies that systematically employ C-H oxidation and complexity generating C-C bond forming reactions. This proposal seeks to establish allylic C-H bonds as a new functional group for widespread use in complex molecule synthesis. To achieve this goal we will exploit a highly versatile �-allyPd intermediate, accessed through allylic C-H cleavage, and develop general strategies by which it can participate in diverse reaction types with consistently high selectivities. Collectively, we expect these Pd(II)-catalyzed allylic C-H functionalization reactions to become fundamental tools for streamlining the synthesis of important structural motifs found in natural products, bioactive compounds, and medicinal agents. Moreover, the general principles that emerge from this approach will be broadly applicable to the field of C-H activation.)"

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary focus of this proposal is the discovery and development of highly selective, catalytic allylic C-H functionalization reactions that can be broadly applied to synthesis. Using these reactions to develop strategies for effecting highly efficient syntheses of molecules with valuable properties is one of our ultimate objectives. Another key objective is the mechanistic study of such systems in order to elucidate new fundamental principles of catalyst design and chemical reactivity. We have recently discovered a new class of sulfoxide-based palladium allylic C-H oxidation catalysts that provide access to either linear (E)-allylic acetates or branched allylic acetates from a wide variety of terminal olefin substrates. The distinctive features of these allylic C-H oxidation systems is that they require no heteroatom directing functional group on the substrate to achieve high reactivity and regioselectivity and are extraordinarily functional group tolerant. This revised grant application details our plans to fully optimize, based upon preliminary findings, these two reactions for use in fine chemical synthesis. Towards this goal, we have new preliminary data that: 1. identifies conditions to effect catalytic enantioselective branched allylic oxidation, 2. supports the claim that the allylic C-H macrolactonization method we propose to develop will have broad scope, 3. suggests that other nucleophiles will be competent for allylic C-H functionalization. On the basis of these results, we propose the following: 1. detailed mechanistic studies to determine the nature of reactive intermediates in the two allylic oxidation systems and the effects of sulfoxide and BQ on their formation and reactivity; 2. development of the branched allylic oxidation reaction into an enantioselective process and macrolactonization method for widespread use in synthesis, 3. optimization and use of the linear allylic oxidation reaction to effect a highly streamlined route to the hexoses, 4. exploration of the Pd/sulfoxide reaction manifolds for effecting a broad range of allylic C-H functionalization reactions. The discovery and development of mild and selective C-H functionalization methods, like the ones described in this proposal, stands to impact significantly on both the rate and expense in which new drugs are discovered and manufactured."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diversification of readily accessible natural products and related compounds for drug development is a frontier goal in the 21st century. The novel scaffolds provided by such compounds, often rich with stereocenters, confer desirable biological properties and selective modes of action. Current synthetic methods are limited in their ability tointroduce new functionality onto organic frameworks and as a result, these structures remain underutilized as drug candidates. Nature routinely uses sustainable iron-based P450 enzymes that oxidize sp3-hybridized C-H bonds (i.e. aliphatic, allylic, and benzylic) to introduce functionality onto complex molecular scaffolds, often with exquisite site-, chemo-, and stereoselectivity. This proposal seeks to develop catalysts that achieve enzyme-like selectivity for sp3 C-H oxidation, amination, alkylation, and halogenation reactions with the high substrate generality and operational ease characteristic of small molecule catalysis. These catalysts will employ iron and manganese, highly abundant, non-toxic, and relatively unexplored metals that present the exciting opportunity to discover reactivity that is orthogonal to extensively explored noble metal catalysts (Rh, Ru). To achieve this goal we will contribute novel catalysts and design strategies that evaluate control elements like electronics, chirality, and sterics for non-heme iron complexes (Fe(PDP)) that have already demonstrated the ability to effect preparative and predictably selective aliphatic C-H oxidations in complex molecule settings. These novel catalysts will address significant outstanding problems in aliphatic C-H oxidation such as chemoselectivity (tolerance of more electron rich unsaturated and heteroatom functionality), enantioselectivity, and achieving alternate modes of site-selectivity. We will continue to contribute novel catalyst platforms for selective C(sp3)-H aminations and alkylations that exploit the isoelectronic nature and mechanistic similarities of metal nitrenes and carbenes with metal oxos. The observed biomimetic reactivity of Fe(PDP) will be further explored to achieve stereoselective halogenations of aliphatic 3o C-H sites. Additionally, current catalysts will be refined to increase catalysts lifetimes. Collectively, we expect these aliphatic, allylic, and benzylic C-H functionalization reactions to enable the rapid synthesis and diversification of complex biologically relevant molecules that were otherwise inaccessible as pharmaceutical scaffolds. Additionally, we will continue refine our mathematical model, which quantitatively correlates the electronic, steric, and stereoelectronic properties of a substrate to site-selectiviy as a function of catalyst, via addition of new substrate classes (arenes, olefins, heterocycles, amines, ethers). The model will also be explored for its ability to inform catalyst design. The fundamental knowledge that will be gained from these studies will serve to redefine the physical organic properties of 'inert' C-H bonds and will inform future catalyst and reaction designs."

"Project Summary The biological activity of organic molecules is strongly impacted by the oxygen, nitrogen and carbonfunctional groups on their hydrocarbon scaffolds. Classically, the practice of organic synthesis has focused onbuilding these scaffolds while concurrently introducing this functionality. We hypothesized that, analogous tonature, a late stage oxidation strategy, i.e., direct introduction of oxidized functionality into C(sp3)-H bonds ofmolecule scaffolds, would provide opportunities to diversify molecular structures and streamline syntheses.Our preliminary studies using novel transition metal catalysts have validated late stage C-H oxidation as apowerful approach for streamlining synthetic sequences and directly diversifying natural products and othercomplex structures. Building on this strong foundation, we plan to discover new catalysts to expand the scopeof C(sp3)-H functionalizations possible. These reactions will broaden the functionality that can be introduced,sites that can be accessed, and classes of natural products and medicinal compounds that can be derivatizedand synthesized. The key to our approach is to develop transition metal catalysts that mediate C(sp3)-H bond cleavageand functionalization, enabling tunable control over reactivity, as well as site-, chemo-, and stereoselectivity.We have discovered and commercialized palladium/sulfoxide catalysts for allylic C-H functionalizations, ironcatalysts for aliphatic C-H hydroxylations, and manganese catalysts for intramolecular C(sp3)-H aminations.These catalysts proceed with unprecedented levels of reactivity and tunable selectivities in complex moleculesettings, without the need for directing groups. These reactions and the late stage derivatization approachhave already begun to be utilized by pharmaceutical companies in drug discovery and metabolite identification.The major challenges in the application of this strategy as a comprehensive C(sp3)-H functionalizationapproach to enable drug discovery are the development of new intermolecular methods and the expandedcapacity for site-, chemo-, and stereoselectivities. To overcome these challenges, we will develop 1) newpalladium/sulfoxide complexes for catalyst-controlled asymmetric induction and complex fragment couplings;2) new base metal complexes for aliphatic C-H hydroxylations that proceed with alternate catalyst-controlled,predictable site selectivities and increased tolerance of π-systems and nitrogen-containing compounds; and 3)new base metal complexes for intra- and intermolecular C-H amination and alkylations. Analogous to theimpact of cross-coupling methods on C(sp2)-C(sp2) bond formation in drug discovery, these reactions willultimately empower scientists to form C(sp3)-O, -N, and -C bonds from ubiquitous C(sp3)-H bonds in complexmolecule scaffolds. This will reinvigorate efforts to explore natural products and other complex molecules assources of medicines and biological research tools."
