"? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social and online media are inextricably linked to HIV/STI transmission behaviors and risks by motivating risk behaviors and social contacts in ways not available before the age of Twitter and online hookups. These online social influences are also shaped by and interact with structural biological and social vulnerabilities, including network HIV/STI prevalence as well as the economic and social capital of the population. In this application, we propose an investigation into this complex and difficult problem by modeling the influence of online communications (e.g., Twitter, selected dating/hookup sites linguistically analyzed) and regularly updated, accessible online structural (societal and environmental) data that can influence HIV/STI. The project will provide understanding and prediction of how new HIV and STI diagnoses are affected by temporally and geographically localized online communication and structural factors, using a theoretical model in which linguistic contents interact with social and biological vulnerabilities in an environment (for theory based, top- down analyses), as well as bottom-up, exploratory, data-driven analyses. Cutting-edge cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of county and zip-code level data are proposed to understand online social communications and structural factors relevant to HIV/STI. Nine models will refine and assess the generalizability of findings with the most readily available but coarse data (i.e., singe year surveillance reported by county or longitudinal surveillance reported yearly by county), and their validity when compared with the more detailed longitudinal models (surveillance reported quarterly in Philadelphia zip codes). The analyses will entail 3 cross-sectional and 6 longitudinaltests predicting new HIV/STI diagnoses in Philadelphia zip codes, US counties, and the zip codes of the most populated US counties. The project will provide understanding and prediction of how new HIV and STI diagnoses are affected by temporally and geographically localized online communication and structural factors, using a theoretical model in which linguistic contents interact with social and biological vulnerabilities in an environment (for theory based, top- down analyses), as well as bottom-up, exploratory, data driven analyses. With a degree of geographic and temporal precision not feasible or cost effective with prior methods, the proposed models should spatially identify future HIV/STI hotspots in real time (at the level of zipcode and linked to references to specific venues or venue types), and in relation to references to specific groups (e.g., MSM [Men who have Sex with Men]). This tracking should in turn pinpoint times, spaces and social groups in urgent need of prevention and care mobilization in the immediate future. All tools will then be used to develop HIVRadar, a tool that health departments will be able to use to perform similar tracking and prediction."
"DESCRIPTION: This proposal concerns the application of recent theoretical developments in the area of attitude and behavior change to the design of HIV-prevention interventions to reduce sexual risk behavior. Four projects will be developed by the PI and her team. Project 1 (currently funded through an R01) comprises a field experiment concerning selective exposure to HIV-prevention materials and participation in HlV-prevention counseling interventions. Its results will allow us to estimate which people are likely to come into contact with preventive programs and to design these programs in ways that attract the most reluctant audiences. Project 2 will include the collection of pilot data for a randomized control trial to study the influence of the interventionist's expertise vs. laity, as well as the demographic similarity between the facilitators and recipients of HIV-prevention intervention, primarily among African-Americans. This project will yield invaluable data concerning the best selection of experts and lays for maximal impact of HIV-prevention interventions on the reduction of sexual risk behavior for gender- and ethnicity-diverse populations. Project 3 will study the influence of action goals (thinking about having sex, intentions to be abstinent) on the formation and change of attitudes and behaviors in this domain through a series of preparatory laboratory experiments, and a pilot field study. Thus, Project 3 will provide the basis for investigating the degree to which sexual abstinence and sexual activity intentions may increase the effectiveness of HIV-prevention interventions for audiences with well- vs. ill-formed attitudes about risk reduction practices. Project 4 will comprise pilot experiments on the influence of interventions that conflict with the likely subsequent behavior of recipients and the need to refine them anticipating noncompliance behavior. This pilot research is essential to replicate our earlier findings that making unrealistic requests as part of a preventive intervention elicits noncompliance and ultimately leads to recipients' inferences that they have a negative attitude about risk reduction behaviors. The career development plan focuses on activities designed to advance the candidate's progress toward senior status and leadership in the field, including conference attendance, conference organization, collaboration with senior scientists, as well as training of students, postdoctoral associates, and junior faculty, and dissemination of research in the community."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests funding for a scientific conference (Organizers Drs. Albarracin, del Rio, DiClemente, and Rothman) titled Theoretical Integration of HIV-Relevant Behavior Change Across Individuals, Family/Couple, and Community/Social Structures. The main goal of the conference is to generate an integrative theory (i.e., set of statements purported to provide a necessary and sufficient explanation of a complex phenomenon) of behavior change that takes into account various systems relevant to HIV prevention (i.e., the individual, the family/couple, the community/broader structural issues) and that addresses how the different levels influence individual behavior and clinical outcomes. This integration requires synthesizing research findings and inferring general principles that can inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of HIV prevention interventions. Relevant questions to be examined include: What are the limitations of current behavior change interventions? How could their impact be larger? What is the impact of family- and community-level interventions on the individual- level beliefs, emotions, and/or behaviors that can ultimately lead to change? What are the mediators and moderators of this impact? What are the reciprocal relations between changes in the individual and the broader systems? How can we explain these reciprocal relations? What techniques can produce change initiated at different levels? How can interventions at different levels be combined or designed to be complementary so that they effectively promote and sustain behavior change? What are the principles that guide such combinations? A first-rate cadre of 40 researchers from basic and applied areas (including women, ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities) will work towards this integration, make a presentation at the conference, work collaboratively with other scientists to produce a report, and publish a journal issue reporting their joint contribution. The organizers are active researchers in the social, medical, and behavioral sciences and have extensive conference-organizing and theory-building experience; they will lead the pre- and post-conference work, as well as the dissemination of the theoretical integration via journal articles, symposia at other conferences, a report, and a press release. The conference will be 3 days filled with presentations led by specially formed workgroups. Some teams will address the integration from particular starting points (e.g., Migration, poverty, gender, and race as structural conditions linked to belief and behavior change), whereas others will be in charge of synthesizing relations across the different intervening systems. The conference will advance the science of HIV prevention by providing the proposed theoretical integration, which is documented to likely influence the scientific literature as well as efficacious and innovative HIV behavior change intervention strategies. The conference is timely given an examination of the influence of prior theoretical integrations in the area of HIV and current advances in biological methods to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. It is also timely given the current NIMH agenda of understanding structural health inequalities, fostering researchers' interactions surrounding translational research, and advancing the study of health promotion from different levels of analysis. The conference location is Atlanta, GA, and offers advantages for the cost of the project, the recruitment of the audience of researchers, community members, and policy-makers. There is ample minority representation in the team of organizers and among the speakers. A conference with a team of leading researchers is proposed to help design an integrative theory that will maximize the development of effective and innovative interventions to change HIV-related behaviors. The contributions of the individual, the family, and the community will be analyzed to understand how to maximize the favorable impacts of interventions at all these levels. Various clinical outcomes are emphasized, which are relevant to prevention and treatment of many existing diseases."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimal health outcomes for people living with HIV often depend on orchestrating behavioral changes at many levels, including adhering to antiretroviral regimens, reducing alcohol and drug use, engaging in protective sex and drug-related behaviors, and keeping healthy exercise, smoking, and dietary habits. Any of these behaviors represents a challenge on its own, proof of which is the finding that behavioral interventions have small to moderate effects in all of these domains. The challenge of simultaneously changing all of these behaviors is even greater, but the potential for revolutionary advances is also unsurpassed. We argue that the science of multiple-behavior interventions must include a comprehensive rationale that informs the combinations of behaviors that maximize behavioral, clinical, and economic outcomes while minimizing iatrogenic effects. The project is expected to yield a comprehensive understanding of multiple behavior change and techniques to achieve it, an interactive website for researchers to use the data, and decision trees to derive combinatorial recommendations for different populations, facilitators, geographic areas, disease prevalence contexts, and delivery settings. This application requests funding to decode the best ways of changing multiple behaviors by taking into account that some behavior combinations or couplings are more likely to be synergistic than others. Given the unfeasibility, times, and costs of combining behaviors in all four target domains (e.g., over 20 behaviors) within a randomized controlled trial, we propose to meta-analyze the behavioral and clinical outcomes of interventions that address at least two health behaviors within and across the domains of HIV-related behaviors, drug and alcohol use, and healthy living. Research Synthesis I will concern HIV-specific interventions that explicitly address two or more behaviors (e.g., condom use, number of partners, medication adherence, and drug use during sex). Research Synthesis II will consider interventions to change multiple alcohol/drug use behaviors (e.g., alcohol use and adherence to methadone treatment). Research Synthesis III will consider interventions to change multiple healthy-lifestyle behaviors (e.g., fat intake, exercise, and smoking). Research Synthesis IV will reach broader conclusions across the domains addressed in Syntheses I-III. The project will be the most ambitious meta-analysis in the area of HIV, and will provide data-driven and theory-based estimates of comparative efficacy and effectiveness, stratified by different genders, different racial groups, different continents, and areas of high and low disease prevalence. Given its breadth, our project will be significant to the prevention and treatment of HIV as well as many other diseases related to our clusters of behaviors, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, among others. In addition, our project will advance the psychological understanding of early and delayed behavior change and the design of behavioral interventions addressing complex behaviors. The novelty of the project stems from a transformative theory, obtaining previously inexistent data, refined statistical methods, and pairing meta- analysis and effectiveness research in unprecedented ways."
"PROJECT ABSTRACT Enrollment and retention are critical components of the effectiveness of HIV- prevention interventions in real-world conditions and have established psychological determinants (Albarrac√¿n, Durantini, et al., in press; Noguchi et al., 2007). Without enrollment, HIV-prevention interventions simply cannot have a public health impact (Albarrac√¿n, Durantini, et al., in press; Noguchi et al., 2007). Without retention, efficacious multi-session interventions to reduce HIV risk cannot be implemented with either fidelity or effectiveness. Currently, interventions that are tested under conditions similar to the ones that are likely during actual implementation show relatively low retention (Noguchi et al., 2007), even though retention strongly predicts behavior change. More importantly, no psychological methods to increase retention have been evaluated before. This application for renewal of R01 NR08325 requests five years of funding to test two innovative communication methods to increase retention, defined as return to the sessions of a one-on-one multi-session HIV-prevention-counseling program. These methods are based on a social psychological model of selective exposure in which retention is a function of motives to achieve self-validation (i.e., empowering) and objective outcomes (i.e., emotional/social and instrumental support beyond HIV prevention). In the proposed study, 656 clients from STI (sexual-transmitted- infection) clinics in Duval County (Florida) will be recruited and randomly assigned to one four study arms. At the end of the counseling first session, participants will receive a videotaped message that either does or does not contain a video to empower clients to take control of their behavior change by returning to the next session (self-validation message), and that either does or does not describe the counseling sessions as a source of emotional/social support for clients, as well as information about, detection of, and referral for health problems in addition to HIV (e.g., related to cardiovascular health). Altogether, the design is a 2-way factorial with four cells. The outcome of the study will be measured by the mean number of completed sessions after the presentation of the video. Based on our past success with this line of research, the proposed project can be expected to provide tools to maximize intervention effectiveness and to illuminate the psychological pathways leading to intervention retention. For example, these innovative messages may be used to increase retention during the implementation of the available arsenal of outstanding efficacious interventions to reduce HIV, STIs, and the consequences of HIV and STIs (e.g., cancer, diseases of the central nervous system). The Florida populations that are directly implicated have alarming HIV prevalence and incidence, both of which may decrease with improved retention in HIV-prevention interventions. In addition, the public health impact of the project is likely to extend to other affected areas in the United States and the world."

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present project will test psychological methods to increase retention for people who enroll in interventions designed to reduce risk for infection with HIV and STIs. Increasing retention can decrease risky behaviors that ultimately compromise health (e.g., cervical cancer and immune deficiencies) and can lead to death. The Florida populations that are directly implicated have alarming HIV/STI prevalence and incidence. In addition, the public health impact of the project is likely to extend to other areas of the United States and the world."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is to model how people decode speech sounds. The main application of this knowledge is to solve the problem of 'signal-to-noise ratio loss,' or SNR-Loss, a condition of the hearing impaired where a person is hypersensitive to noise. Under conditions of optimum frequency dependent amplification a person with SNR-Loss requires a better SNR to understand speech as a normal hearing person, for the same score. Existing methods for diagnosing SNR-Loss do not provide insight into the nature of the problem. What we wish to develop is a measure of SNR-Loss that identifies which sounds are being lost, and at what SNR. In this research we have demonstrated that people with hearing loss have problems hearing only a small number of sounds, and that these confusable sounds differ from ear to ear, depending on the particular hearing loss. Out of the 16 ears we have tested, we have not found any two ears that are the same. The hearing impaired (HI) have more trouble hearing speech in noise than normal hearing people. We would like to provide a scientific basis for why this happens, by measuring the most confusable sounds that the impaired ear find most difficult. We have discovered that only a few sounds are confused, and they are different for different ears. We shall answer the questions: 'Specifically which perceptual consonant features are not audible to each hearing impaired listener?', 'How does this audibility and confusability change as a function of the background noise and amplification?'"
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bilateral implantation has yielded considerable improvements in cochlear implant (CI) performance. However, bilateral CIs are generally programmed clinically as two independent devices. As a result, the full potential of bilateral implants remains untapped. Multiple electrodes can activate overlapping neural populations and thus cause similar percepts ('perceptual overlap'). Perceptual overlap between ears is critical for perceiving binaural cues, particularly interaural time difference. Bilateral CIs can be optimized to maximize the perceptual overlap of electrodes that are matched-up across ears ('matching'), which is not currently done clinically. Perceptual overlap within each ear can considerably limits CI performance. Bilateral CIs can be optimized to reduce the perceptual overlap between electrodes by dividing the signal across the ears, sending adjacent frequency regions to opposite ears ('interleaving'). With matching, where the same frequency regions are sent to both ears, electrodes that are bilaterally matched need to yield the maximum perceptual overlap. With interleaving, where signals from different frequency regions are sent to opposite ears, such pairings need to be avoided. The benefits of matching versus interleaving may vary across patients, and some patients may receive optimal benefit from combining the two methods over different portions of the electrode array. Our long-term goal is to optimize bilateralstimulation for difficult listening situations. We hypothesize that optimally pairing electrodes across ears will improve the perception of spatial cues. We also hypothesize that minimizing the perceptual overlap within and across ears will provide additional spectral cues. Finally, we hypothesize that combining bilateral matching and interleaving for different cochlear regions will maximize the benefit of bilateral implantation."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fragile X mental retardation is caused by the absence of expression of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, FMRP. FMRP is an RNA binding protein found in a large, RNA-protein complex called a messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particle. FMRP is located primarily in the cytoplasm but shuttles into and out of the nucleus. All of these functions - nuclear translocation, RNA binding, and protein-protein interactions - have been shown in other systems to be modulated by phosphorylation. In preparations from rat brain, there is evidence that stimulation of the group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) increases expression of rodent FMRP (Fmrp). We propose that mGluR stimulation, which activates kinases, results in the phosphorylation the Fmrp containing-mRNP to modulate its function. We will characterize the role of phosphorylation on Fmrp function through the use of transfected cell lines, purified recombinant Fmrp and neuronal cultures in the following specific aims: 1. Examine the role of tyrosine phosphorylation on the intracellular localization, RNA binding, and protein-protein interactions of Fmrp. 2. Identify serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate Fmrp and characterize the role of this phosphorylation on the intracellular localization, RNA binding and protein-protein interactions of Fmrp. 3. Characterize the effect of m-GluR-stimulation on the mRNP containing the FmrI mRNA. Understanding how phosphorylation affects Fmrp function, particularly in response to receptor stimulation in the brain, will give insight into the normal function of Fmrp, as well as how its absence leads to mental retardation."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP binds ~4% of brain mRNAs but it is still unknown how FMRP regulates their translation. The preliminary data demonstrate association of the putative RNA helicase MOV10 with FMRP. The objective of the proposed research is to understand how MOV10 interacts with FMRP to regulate translation of its associated mRNAs. The hypothesis is that MOV10 regulates translation of FMRP-bound mRNAs by unfolding secondary structures in the RNA. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding how MOV10 functions will give insight into translation regulation, including virus production and the microRNA pathway. MOV10 also activates translation of the FMR1 mRNA, which could lead to novel treatment strategies. Specific Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that MOV10 unwinds secondary structures in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) to facilitate translation initiation. Methods: Use single-molecule FRET to examine whether MOV10 unfolds RNAs, use translation assays to examine whether MOV10 activates translation and cell culture assays to examine how FMRP recruits MOV10. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that MOV10 suppresses translation of some FMRP-associated mRNAs by unwinding structures in the 3'UTR to expose target sequences for miRNA-mediated suppression. Methods: examine the miRNA- dependence of MOV10-FMRP regulation of PSD-95 and NR2A luciferase reporters using the methods described in Specific Aim1. Specific Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that the mRNAs in the FMRP-MOV10 complex are the FMRP-associated mRNAs that are regulated at the level of translation by MOV10. Methods: isolate the shared RNAs using serial immunoprecipitation to capture FMRP-MOV10-RNA complexes from brain and identify the captured RNAs by deep sequencing, as well as the specific region of the RNA bound by MOV10 using HITS-CLIP. The contribution of the proposed research is to understand how translation of FMRP-associated mRNAs is regulated. It is innovative because it uses single-molecule approaches to characterize a new helicase and focuses on a novel approach for understanding how FMRP regulates translation of its bound mRNAs through MOV10."

Understanding how the RNAs bound by FMRP are regulated at the translational level will give insight into new therapeutic strategies. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to help reduce the burdens of human disability."
"? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is caused by excessive neuronal excitability characterized by seizures, which are abnormal and uncontrolled discharges of action potentials. This common brain disorder is often caused by mutations in ion channels that form the basis for neuronal intrinsic excitability. Voltage-gated Kv7/KCNQ K+ channels potently inhibit repetitive and burst firing of action potentials. Kv7 activators are used as anti-epileptic drugs whereas mutations in Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 subunits cause epilepsy in humans. My work has shown that some epilepsy mutations impair polarized enrichment of Kv7 channels at the axonal surface, the subcellular domain governing action potential initiation and conduction, suggesting that their correct axonal targeting is critical for their physiologic function. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The goal of this proposal is to understand how axonal targeting of Kv7 channels is achieved and regulated by epilepsy mutations and neuronal activity, and how basal and regulated targeting impacts intrinsic excitability. This proposal is significant because dissecting these 'unexplored' mechanisms will increase our understanding of the role of axonal Kv7 channels in regulating excitability, and foster the development of new therapeutic strategies for epilepsy that could enhance axonal surface density of Kv7. Given that chronic blockade of neuronal activity in hippocampus leads to temporal lobe epilepsy, characterizing the regulation of Kv7 axonal targeting by chronic activity blockade of hippocampal neurons may provide mechanistic insights into plasticity of intrinsic excitability and epileptogenesis. My work has shown that Kv7 enrichment at the axonal surface involves a region in the Kv7.2 C- terminal tail upstream of ankyrin-G binding domain. This 'axon-targeting' domain contains phosphorylation sites and interacts with calmodulin, syntaxin 1A, AKAP79/150 and PIP2. In our preliminary studies, we discover that Kv7 axonal targeting is regulated by calmodulin-mediated exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, dynamin-mediated endocytosis, and phosphorylation of Kv7.2. We further show that homeostatic increase in excitability induced by chronic activity blockade accompanies reduction in Kv7 current, Kv7.3, and AKAP150. Based on these data, our hypothesis is that Kv7.2 interacting molecules and phosphorylation mediate basal and activity-regulated Kv7 axonal targeting by linking Kv7 to the core traffic machinery for polarized targeting. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will determine the traffic pathways that mediate Kv7 axonal targeting. Aim 2 will identify Kv7.2 interacting proteins and phosphorylation that bind to the core traffic machinery for polarized targeting. Aim 3 will characterize the regulation of Kv7 axonal targeting by chronic activity blockade. To execute these aims, we will use live imaging, immunostaining, binding assays, and electrophysiology in dissociated and organotypic hippocampal cultures, which preserve the functional and morphological polarity of neurons. We will also utilize epilepsy mutations, knock-out mice, and in vivo alterations of neuronal activity."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project continues our investigation of the production and perception of phonological sequences. The project's guiding assumption is that the phonological processing system is constantly changing. It adapts to recent experience, while continuing to reflect the accumulated experience of a lifetime of speaking and listening. The proposed research seeks to understand the adaptability of the phonological processing system, with an emphasis on the malleability of the system's use of general phonological patterns, such as phonotactic constraints. It is well known that speech errors or slips of the tongue exhibit the phonotactic regularity effect: Errors rarely create combinations of sounds that are illegal in the language being spoken. For example, an English speaker might mispronounce 'nun' as 'nung', but not 'ngung' because that violates the constraint of English that 'ng' can never begin a syllable. We created a laboratory analog to this effect and used it to demonstrate learning. Experimental subjects recited strings of syllables in which consonants were artificially restricted to particular positions in syllables; for example, /f/ always occurred as a syllable onset. As subjects experienced these syllables, their slips became strongly sensitive to the distributions of the consonants. For example, nearly every misplacement of /f/ obeyed the rule that /f/ is an onset for this experiment. These data suggest that subjects implicitly learned the sound distributions, and this learning affected their productions. We demonstrated the same effect in perception. Subjects listened to syllables with consonant-position restrictions; in a later speeded repetition task, new syllables that were consistent with the phonotactics of the experiment were repeated more rapidly than syllables that were inconsistent. The proposed research uses these techniques to investigate learning mechanisms in the phonological processing system. The studies manipulate the phonological patterns to be acquired and make direct comparisons between production and perception and between learning by adults and infants. These experiments are informed by psychological theories of learning and linguistic theories of representation, and the obtained data will be used to constrain development of computational models of implicit learning in the phonological processing system. The research will yield a new understanding of how the processing system responds to experience, which ultimately will contribute to the treatment of language disorders and to language pedagogy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The project studies how implicit learning, that is, learning by doing, shapes the way that we perceive and produce speech. As such, the proposed research will contribute to the understanding and, ultimately, the remediation of developmental and acquired speech, language, and reading pathologies. Therapies for language pathology often assume that learning is taking place, but current methods are not based on precise theories of learning mechanisms. Consequently, an analysis of such mechanisms in a specific domain -- here, phonotactic learning -- has the potential to make a notable contribution to the development of therapeutic interventions. If we discover how the speech processing systems of infants, older children, and adults change naturally with experience, we can use this knowledge to engineer changes that can benefit individuals of all ages who suffer from linguistic and reading disorders."
"Project Summary/Abstract Long ago, Sigmund Freud said that speech errors reveal unconscious knowledge. Today, Freud'snotion is most often called upon with regard to implicit linguistic knowledge. For example, speakers implicitlyknow the phonotactic patterns of their language, such as the fact that in English/h/ must be a syllable onset,and /ng/ must be a syllable coda. When an /h/ slips to another syllable, it will invariably occupy the onset slot,thus implicitly revealing the phonotactic constraint on its location. This project uses an experimental analogueto this effect to investigate how the language production system changes in response to experience. Language learning never stops. Each utterance changes the language production system so that itfunctions more effectively in that and similar circumstances. The failure to adapt can hinder languageacquisition or delay recovery from acquired disorders. This project investigates such adaptation by studyinghow sensitivity to phonotactic constraints in production changes with experience. It does so throughexperiments and computational modeling. In the proposed experiments, participants recite strings of syllables that unbeknownst to them follownovel phonotactic constraints. For example, for a particular participant, whenever a syllable contains theconsonant /f/, it appears only in onset position. The learning of the novel constraint is revealed in theparticipant's slips. Prior work has demonstrated that simple constraints, such as /f/ being restricted to onsetposition during the experiment, are quickly learned and influence the speaker's slips within minutes. Morecomplex constraints appear to require a consolidation period (e.g. a day) before they come out in slips. Otherconstraints appear to be unlearnable. The central aim of the project is to confront these findings by developingand testing a theory of phonotactic learning that explains the adaptability of the production system. Theproposed experiments test alternative accounts of learning and seek to show how this learning relatesgenerally to language learning and use. The proposed computational work develops models of phonotacticlearning that are capable of simulating the experimental findings."
"The training program in language processing seeks to train scientists who can advance our understanding of the cognitive basis of human communication. For predoctoral trainees, the program offers a coherent set of formal courses; advanced topics research seminars, and research training in experimental psycholinguistics and computational modeling. For postdoctoral trainees, the program offers opportunities for broadening skills in preparation for careers in linguistics or cognitive neuroscience. For students at all levels, the program offers broad and balanced training as scaffolding for the development of outstanding researchers. The research of the program faculty spans language acquisition, language production, language comprehension, and reading. This breadth fosters abilities in conceptual analysis and theoretical development across the full range of core components of human language use. The methodological expertise of the program faculty encompasses eye-movement monitoring, computational modeling, event-related-potential recording, and the basic techniques of cognitive research. This range gives trainees the opportunity to attain high levels of skill in designing, implementing, and interpreting experiments using state-of-the-art methods for probing the workings of language processing. Funds are requested to support four predoctoral and two postdoctoral trainees per year. The predoctoral training program demands four years beyond the bachelor's degree. It fulfills the basic requirements for the doctoral degree within the cognitive division of the Department of Psychology, using division options to create doctoral-program plans with a major emphasis on the experimental study of language processing and minor emphases on linguistics, cognitive neuroscience, and reading. The postdoctoral program offers training in language processing as a supplement for doctoral training in linguistics or cognitive neuroscience. The proposed training will take place within a strong institutional matrix formed by the Cognitive Division of the Department of Psychology and the Cognitive Science Group at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. Both settings offer exceptional physical and intellectual resources fueled by a rich tradition of graduate training in psycholinguistics."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The capacity to comprehend language lies at the core of a person's ability to gain information from the environment, perform everyday tasks, and maintain normal social relations. The critical role of the left cerebral hemisphere (LH) in supporting these processes has served as a paradigmatic example of neural specialization for higher cognitive functions. However, it is increasingly apparent that the right hemisphere (RH) also makes important, distinctive contributions to language comprehension. The aim of the proposed research is to delineate how processing resources distributed across the two cerebral hemispheres come together in real time to mediate language and how these processes and their underlying mechanisms change over the course of normal aging and in response to task demands. The proposal builds on a theoretical framework, based on recent neuropsychological, behavioral, and event-related brain potential (ERP) studies of language asymmetry, which asserts that LH and RH language comprehension differ because comprehension is cognitively and neurally integrated with language production only in the LH. Seventeen proposed experiments, using ERPs (often in combination with visual half-field presentation techniques to preferentially stimulate one hemisphere) and eyetracking measures with both young and older adults, test the hypotheses that (1) differences in the efficacy of neural connectivity within each hemisphere and across age set up qualitatively different processing dynamics during language comprehension, (2) these differences in processing dynamics can be modulated by factors such as stimulus predictability, task demands, and control - yielding different functional outcomes and (3) the roots of processing dynamics important for language comprehension can be traced to genetic factors that affect neural circuitry important for hand preference. These experiments lay the foundation for an understanding of the computational and neurobiological roots of the complex and critical cognitive skill that is language."

The proposed research examines language comprehension differences across the two cerebral hemispheres and as a function of age in order to understand what factors characterize and promote effective language processing. The long-term goal is to uncover ways to protect against or compensate for age-, trauma-, or disease-related reductions in the ability to comprehend and remember language."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One goal of research on intact auditory systems is to provide a basis for studying the deficits produced by hearing loss and for understanding how damage to the ear may alter the way the brain normally codes information from communication sounds such as speech. A central aim of the proposed study is to evaluate neural activity of central auditory neurons in frogs under conditions that simulate sudden hearing loss, a deficit that produces an acute, rapid-onset hearing impairment. Sudden hearing loss often occurs in one ear, can show partial recovery, and may recur in repeated bouts resulting in a progressive and permanent hearing loss. More than forty causes have been associated with this deficit. The proposed study is unique in that it will evaluate neural function during a rapidly induced hearing loss in non-human animals without damaging the ear. This approach allows the direct comparison of neurophysiological activity under conditions of intact hearing with the effects of hearing loss in each central auditory neuron. The reversible hearing loss is induced by cooling of an auditory nerve where it passes from the ear to the brain to create a temporary hearing loss from one ear. Local cooling of the nerve is achieved by placing the tip of a small cooling probe (&lt; 0.15 mm) close to the nerve; the cooling stops transmission of activity in the nerve, the effect is rapidly reversible upon passive warming, and the procedure is repeatable. The effect of hearing loss will be investigated in auditory nerve cells that typically receive information from both ears. The hypothesis is that hearing sensitivity and frequency selectivity will be poorer with unilateral hearing loss than with intact binaural hearing; responses to monaural stimulation but with intact hearing are expected to show intermediate characteristics. Neurophysiological recordings of single unit activity will be made to evaluate binaural responses, characteristic frequency, threshold, rate-level functions, and frequency response areas. Neural responses will be evaluated when the temporary hearing loss is induced on the same and the opposite side of the recording site in the auditory midbrain to define the contribution of each ear. The focus of this study is to understand how hearing loss in one ear affects the sensitivity and selectivity of auditory neurons for encoding sound."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to describe and automatically recognize the audible and visible correlates of phonological contrasts as produced by persons with spastic dysarthria. In order to meet the primary aim, this investigation will: - enroll a total of 16 subjects with dysarthria and 16 control subjects, - record each subject's production of phonetically balanced and pragmatically useful speech material using our AVICAR array of eight microphones and four video cameras, - measure the acoustic and visible correlates of consonant place of articulation, including formant locus, frication spectrum, lip aperture area, and jaw height, - develop automatic audio-only and audiovisual isolated word recognition algorithms, and - record each subject's participation in an objective comparison of audiovisual speech recognition, audio-only speech recognition, and typing as text input methods for human computer interface. LAY LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Subjects whose neuromotor deficit precludes or hinders their use of a keyboard may nevertheless retain some control over speech articulators. Our preliminary data demonstrate that subjects with 19-30% intelligibility (as rated by human listeners) may nevertheless achieve 90-100% recognition accuracy in an automatic isolated digit recognition task. We have found that the use of video in automatic speech recognition improves word recognition accuracy for talkers without dysarthria; we propose to extend our work to seek the same gains for talkers with dysarthria."
"Generation of neural diversity is a key question in developmental neurobiology. Studies inboth vertebrates and invertebrate model organisms have shown that neural progenitors aretemporally patterned to generate different neural types in a defined order, and this order can berecapitulated in progenitors cultured in vitro, suggesting an internal clock. However, themolecule mechanism is not yet clear. The Drosophila medulla is a unique system to addressthis question, because the neural progenitors (neuroblasts) at consecutive temporal stages canbe visualized in one image. Recently a novel Temporal cascade of Transcription Factors (TTFs),Homothorax (Hth), Eyeless (Ey), Sloppy paired 1 and 2 (Slp), Dichaete (D) and Tailless (Tll),were found to be expressed sequentially in medulla neuroblasts as they age. Each gene servesas the ?master regulator? of the corresponding temporal stage, and control neuron identity. Thetemporal transitions between different temporal stages require that one TTF activates the next,and represses the previous one. The activation of the next TTF?s expression is a gradualprocess, and there is a large overlap between successive TTFs in NBs. However, there is asharp transition in the neuronal progeny from expressing one TTF to the next with no overlap.This is critical to generate distinct neural identities in successive temporal stages. This proposalis addressing two fundamental questions of developmental timing control in neural progenitors:1) How is the gradual turning on the next TTF in neural progenitors ?translated? into a sharptemporal transition in the progeny? 2) How is the temporal transition regulated to preciselycontrol the number of neurons born at each stage? The preliminary data suggest a hypothesisin which the expression of the next TTF is activated gradually in NBs by its preceding TTF in acell-cycle dependent way, but the transcription of the next TTF gene is repressed in the progenybefore its protein inherited from the NB reaches a certain threshold to counteract the repression,and then the transition in the neuronal progeny occurs. Further, preliminary data show that theprogression in the temporal gene cascade does not happen when NBs are arrested in the cellcycle, suggesting that the temporal progression is not dependent on the absolute time, but thecell-cycle progression. In summary cell cycle dependent oscillations could serve as the clock,and the progressive and irreversible temporal gene cascade could serve as the accumulativerecord of time with each cell cycle leaving its mark, providing a mechanism to control thenumber of neurons born at each temporal stage."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing loss is a major cause of morbidity and social disengagement in the aging population. Unfortunately, hearing aids, which compensate for the peripheral deficits, do not adequately enhance the intelligibility of speech in real-world situations. This is because a major cause of age-relating hearing loss is the dysfunction of central mechanisms that allow the brain to selectively attend to particular streams of auditory input. One hypothesis to explain the breakdown in this selective attention process is the particular vulnerability of cortical inhibition in the aging brain. We propose to examine the role of age-related loss of inhibition in one neural system that has been implicated in selective auditory attention: the auditory corticothalamic system. We have previously shown that auditory corticothalamic neurons in young adult mice are under substantial inhibitory control and that multiple distinct inhibitory microcircuits exist within the corticothalamic system. We hypothesize that there is an age-associated loss of particular elements within this inhibitory microcircuitry. We will investigate age-related changes in the inhibitory circuitry onto identified auditory corticothalamic neurons using laser scanning photostimulation of caged glutamate in the slice preparation. Specifically, based on our previous work, we will study three particular sets of inhibitory inputs: GABAAergic inputs from layers 2/3 and 5 onto layer 5 corticothalamic neurons and layer 6-derived GABAAergic inputs onto layer 6 corticothalamic neurons. We will also investigate age-related changes in the functional mapping of cortical inputs onto thalamic neurons. We hypothesize that decreases in cortical inhibition will produce a broadening of cortical input onto thalamic cells, and that this may be responsible for the selective auditory attention deficits described above. We will record from individual thalamic neurons in the auditory corticothalamic slice preparation and construct cortical input maps using laser scanning photostimulation. Maps will be compared between young and aged mice and it is expected that aging will broaden these inputs. Our longer term goals are to extend this work to the in vivo preparation to correlate potential age-associated changes in corticothalamic mapping to particular auditory attention deficits. The proposed work will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for age-associated central auditory dysfunction, and may ultimately provide therapeutic targets for amelioration of this highly prevalent condition."

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-associated hearing loss affects approximately one third of older adults and the proposed work will examine the brain mechanisms of this hearing loss. Specifically, we believe that the root of these difficulties is the inability to suppress distracting sounds and that this is caused by dysfunction of particular sets of brain cells. We will test this idea by examining changes in the brain circuitry of the auditory system in aging animal models."
"? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to extract meaning from sounds, even when degraded, is critical for normal hearing. A key strategy employed by the auditory system during acoustically-challenging situations is the use of contextual cues to disambiguate cluttered signals. Importantly, many patients with language-related disorders, such as aphasia, autism and dyslexia, have difficulties harnessing such contextual cues. The neural mechanisms by which high-level information can be used to shape lower-level sensory processing are not yet known. A potential substrate for this type of processing is the massive top-down projection system emanating from virtually every level of the auditory system. In this project, we will provide a functional characterization of one of the largest of these projections: the auditory corticocollicular system. The corticocollicular system can rapidly and profoundly change the tuning of neurons in the inferior colliculus, but key aspects about its organization are not known.We hypothesize that this system comprises at least two functionally distinct sub- systems; one from cortical layer 5 and another from cortical layer 6. Using the mouse model, the cortical distribution of layer 5 and 6 neurons that project to small regions of the inferior colliculus willbe reconstructed and compared. Our early data suggest that input from layer 6 emanates from a more widespread area than layer 5 and tends to predominate in the non-primary parts of the auditory cortex. In addition, we will combine in vivo transcranial flavoprotein autofluoresence imaging with quantitative neuronal reconstructions to compare the projection patterns of layer 5 vs. layer 6 cortical projections to the inferior colliculus. Finally, using a novel corticocolliculr brain slice preparation and laser photostimulation, we will compare the synaptic properties of layer 5 and 6 corticocollicular synapses. Successful completion of this project will provide the first circuit-level characterization of this important pathway and will lay the groundwork for a greater understanding of how top-down modulatory systems break down during disorders of communication."

"? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a capsule of GABAergic neurons that partially envelops the thalamus and has been speculated to play a role in normal cognitive functions, such as selective attention, and in pathological states, such as tinnitus and schizophrenia. Therefore, understanding the function of the auditory portion of the TRN will unlock secrets not only about normal hearing, but also provide insights about how thalamocortical systems become dysfunctional in disease. Unfortunately, the impact of the TRN on sensory processing has been particularly inscrutable because of its small size and deep location. Until now, there has not been an experimental preparation that permitted measurement of thalamic and cortical activity at the cellular level while allowing simultaneous manipulation ofthe TRN and afferent input to the thalamus. We have recently overcome this hurdle by developing a brain slice preparation in the mouse that contains robust connectivity between the inferior colliculus, auditory thalamus, auditory TRN and the auditory cortex (Llano et al. J Neurophysiology 2014, 111(1):197). Herein, we combine the use of this new preparation with a range of optical, electrophysiological and pharmacological tools to test a novel hypothesis: that the TRN produces paradoxical rate- dependent enhancement of the transmission of neural signals as they pass through the colliculo-thalamocortical pathway. This hypothesis is based upon recent findings that the auditory TRN receives non-reciprocal input from wide-ranging neural structures, such as the frontal cortex and amygdala, and that GABAergic input from the TRN produces short windows of hyperexcitability in thalamic neurons by de-inactivating T-type calcium currents. Successful completion of this work will open the doors to future studies that examine the impact of the frontal cortex and amygdala on auditory thalamocortical systems through the TRN, and therefore will shed light on how cognitive and emotional states influence acoustic processing."

"Project SummaryIn this proposal, we request funding for the purchase of a multiphoton microscope system to behoused in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University ofIllinois. The state-of-the-art microscopy system will permit deep-tissue imaging into fixed andlive tissues and serve as a shared resource for multiple investigators at the University of Illinois.The microscope will be outfitted with an extended infrared laser, optogenetic stimulationcapability and an easily moveable stage to permit in vitro as well as in vivo electrophysiologyexperimentation. In addition, the microscope will be supported and managed by the BeckmanInstitute Microscopy Suite, for which there is already dedicated space and full-time Ph.D.-levelstaff to manage the instrument. The microscopy suite is a unit that is fully supported by theBeckman Institute, with paid staff who have extensive experience in managing high-end laser-based microscopy systems. The Microscopy Suite also has infrastructure to ensure maximalutilization of the microscope by NIH-funded users. Eleven major users and one minor user havebeen identified, and their diverse interests represent the interdisciplinary nature of the BeckmanInstitute. The major users come from 8 different departments and use of a multiphotonmicroscope will support their NIH-supported research, with funding coming from 8 differentinstitutes (NCI, NIAID, NIBIB, NIDA, NIDCD, NIMH, NIGMS and NINDS). The major users haveresearch interests in developing novel technology platforms for cancer diagnosis, forunderstanding the biological underpinnings of inherited cognitive disorders, for understandinginvertebrate neurobiology, studying glial-neuronal interactions and others. Therefore, themultiphoton microscope would support both basic and translational research across a variety ofdisciplines, and support ongoing NIH-funded research at Illinois."
"This proposal is a competitive renewal which examines the long-term (5 years) follow-up effects of a six-month exercise program (Illinois Active Aging) on psychological function in older adults (N=174). In addition, a media and telephone booster intervention to increase physical activity and, in turn, psychological function in the original participant sample is proposed. The specific aims are: (a) To examine the shape and form of physical activity participation, physical fitness, and psychosocial function at approximately five years beyond entry into a six-month walking or stretching/toning exercise intervention; (b) To determine which social, psychological, behavioral, and physical factors determine long- term physical activity maintenance; (c) To examine the effects of a six-month telephone and mail-based intervention on physical activity participation and psychological function five years beyond the initial intervention. It is expected that the 'booster' intervention, as compared to the control group will increase their levels of physical activity thereby increasing their physical fitness levels. In addition, it is expected that the intervention will lead to enhanced self-efficacy, self- esteem, and subjective well-being; (d) Finally, the role played by physical activity participation, fitness, and self-efficacy in improved psychological function will be examined. There are several strengths associated with the proposed studies. First, little is known about the long-term effects of exercise programs on the physical and psychological health of older adults beyond the more immediate effects of activity interventions. This project proposes to employ multiple sample latent growth curve methods to map the growth and form of change in these health parameters five years beyond the start of the original randomized controlled trial. No exercise trials to date have attempted to follow subjects for such a length of time. Second, we the proposal is theoretically grounded rather than descriptive and we expect changes in self-efficacy to be instrumental in changes in function. Third, we propose to implement a media/telephone intervention to try to reverse the expected declines in physical activity and psychosocial function. Typically, after standard follow-up assessments in exercise trials, no such efforts are made. As such, the proposed study represents a unique attempt to further understand the role played by physical activity in the psychological health of older Americans."
"A multidisciplinary investigation is proposed to examine the role played by aerobic exercise in enhancing the psychosocial and cognitive functioning of 200 aging adults (60-74 years). A randomized trial will compare effects of an aerobic exercise intervention and a stretching and toning control group engaged in activity for six months in supervised programs with a six month follow-up. It is expected that aerobic exercise program will substantially enhance the physical fitness post-intervention of these subjects and that changes in fitness will result in improved cognitive function (memory and attention) and enhanced psychosocial function (improved psychological well-being and self-efficacy). Whereas it is believed that the particular mechanism of importance in the exercise- cognition relationship is cardiovascular fitness, it is hypothesized that self-efficacy mediates the impact of fitness on psychological well-being. Finally, a true representation of psychological or mental health comprises adequate cognitive function and positive psychological well-being. It will therefore be a further purpose of this project to conduct exploratory analyses examining the relationship between cognitive and psychosocial responses at the end of the program and at follow-up. Both treatment groups are expected to demonstrate relatively low levels of functioning (physical, cognitive, and psychosocial) at baseline and that levels of functioning in the aerobic exercise group will increase markedly over the course of the program as compared to the stretching/toning group. Indeed, if both groups were to demonstrate similar increases in cognitive and psychosocial functioning but differ in degree of aerobic fitness gains (i.e., aerobic will make more marked improvements than the stretching/control group), this would be strong evidence to suggest that fitness gains are not necessary for psychological health improvements, a significant contribution in itself. This investigation attempts to overcome many of the methodological and conceptual problems that make the extant literature in this area equivocal at best. First, the proposed project is theoretically grounded rather than descriptive. Second, the sedentary aging population targeted represents a segment of the population which stand to gain more from exercise than those populations normally studied. Third, multi-method assessment across projects of exercise behavior and physiological function (exercise logs, long-term follow-up, cardiorespiratory function, heart rate), and psychological functioning (memory, attention, efficacy, affect) will be employed, allowing us to comprehensively measure the variables of interest and to determine treatment effects on these constructs, as well as possible interrelations among them. Finally, we include equal numbers of males and females, an appropriate proportion of minorities to be representative of the general older population in the region, and the exercise intervention is to be compared to a non-aerobic control group. The proposed investigation represents a prospective intervention study that is theoretically grounded and has as its objective a comprehensive approach to improving the health and well-being of older Americans."
"A multidisciplinary investigation is proposed to examine the role played by aerobic exercise in enhancing the psychosocial and cognitive functioning of 200 aging adults (60-74 years). A randomized trial will compare effects of an aerobic exercise intervention and a stretching and toning control group engaged in activity for six months in supervised programs with a six month follow-up. It is expected that aerobic exercise program will substantially enhance the physical fitness post-intervention of these subjects and that changes in fitness will result in improved cognitive function (memory and attention) and enhanced psychosocial function (improved psychological well-being and self-efficacy). Whereas it is believed that the particular mechanism of importance in the exercise- cognition relationship is cardiovascular fitness, it is hypothesized that self-efficacy mediates the impact of fitness on psychological well-being. Finally, a true representation of psychological or mental health comprises adequate cognitive function and positive psychological well-being. It will therefore be a further purpose of this project to conduct exploratory analyses examining the relationship between cognitive and psychosocial responses at the end of the program and at follow-up.

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to test the effectiveness of a DVD-delivered home-based physical activity intervention targeting flexibility, toning, and balance (FTB) activities when compared with an attention control condition to reduce functional limitations and enhance functional performance and quality of life (QOL) in older adults. It is hypothesized that participation in this 6-month FTB program will improve functional fitness and balance, reduce functional limitations, and improve overall quality of life at the end of the trial and at 6-month follow-up. A further aim is to longitudinally test the mediators of physical activity effects on functional limitations and quality of life. A final aim is to implement REAIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) principles into the design and evaluation of the proposed study in order to determine the potential public health impact of delivering physical activity via DVD media. The aims and objectives of the proposed application are consistent with the National Institute on Aging's strategies for improving the health and quality of life of older Americans. Additionally, our reach and generalizability of findings are likely to be considerable. We propose to recruit and randomly assign 250 older (65+ years) low-active adults from across central Illinois to the FTB condition to be delivered in the home by DVD or an attention control condition receiving a healthy aging DVD and equivalent contact time. The control condition will be offered the FTB program following the 6- month follow-up assessments. Primary outcome measures are functional performance and functional limitations with secondary outcomes being self-efficacy, physical activity, health status, and quality of life. All measured will be assessed at baseline, six and twelve months. All hypotheses will be tested using latent growth curve modeling within a covariance modeling framework."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although studies have investigated rates of physical activity in African Americans and the overall rates of disability in African Americans, few studies have examined the relationship between physical activity, physical function, and health status in older black adults. Given much lower rates of physical activity in African Americans as compared to whites, it is important to examine in greater detail the extent to which physical activity differentially influences health status in this population and to identify those parameters that mediate this relationship. Levels of physical activity in older women, and particularly older African American women, are extremely poor putting them at elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. This proposal employs a social cognitive framework to examine the longitudinal relationships among physical activity patterns, expectations, balance, gait, and health status in 150 white and 150 black older (age 60-80 years) women. Based upon preliminary studies, we propose that levels of physical activity influence expectations (efficacy and outcome) which influence overall health status through their effects on balance and gait. Additionally, we propose that fear of falling is influenced by efficacy expectations and also has a direct effect on balance. Latent growth curve strategies will be employed to examine developmental change in the model constructs over a two year period. Additionally, the relationships among changes in these variables over the study period will allow conclusions to be drawn relative to the roles played by parameters mediating the relationship between physical activity and health status in older black and white women. Only when we can reliably identify such patterns of relationships will we be effectively able to prescribe and promote public health agendas and programs to maximize health, function, and well-being in all older adults."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health issue. Being African-American affords some protection from osteoporotic fracture primarily due to bone dependent factors such as a higher bone mass, density and shorter hip axis length; however, pilot data from our laboratory also suggests a racial difference in bone independent fracture risk factors including gait, balance and social cognitive factors such as fear of falling. However, to our knowledge, no research has studied the interrelationship between bone dependent and independent fracture risk factors in an older racially diverse sample of postmenopausal women. Additionally, little research has prospectively examined the relation between and among bone dependent and independent risk factors in black and white postmenopausal women. This is important work because black women are among the fastest growing segment of the population and alarming evidence suggests that although fewer black women sustain osteoporotic fractures, they have nearly a three-times greater likelihood of death due to complications from hip fracture. Thus, the primary purpose of this prospective study is to combine physiological bone health outcomes (bone mass, density and ultrasound attenuation), physical activity patterns, and balance and gait abilities with social cognitive outcomes including self-efficacy and expectations, to further elucidate the causes of this racial discrepancy in fracture rate. Secondarily, racial differences in body composition determinants (i.e. fat and fat-free mass) of bone health will be explored at baseline and in a prospective fashion. Per the parent grant design (1R01AG020118-01A1), a large sample of older (60 - 80 yrs) white (N = 150) and black (N = 150) women will be recruited with outcomes assessed at baseline, 1 year and 2 years. Bone and body composition will be assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Additionally, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) will be used as an index of bone quality. This research has high public health priority because bone dependent and independent factors that influence the risk of osteoporotic fracture risk must be understood to implement effective programs for public health agendas and programs, specifically with regards to racial differences thereby optimizing programming for all individuals."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An interaction between the immune system and the brain causes important behavioral changes. Sickness behavior is induced by a transient episode of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the brain. If unabated, the chronic inflammatory response can ultimately lead to development of depressive-like behavior. We recently discovered that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), a hormone that is critical for growth and development and whose endogenous-tonic presence is neuroprotective, inhibits sickness behavior when given either centrally (icv.) or peripherally (i.p.). We now have exciting new preliminary data showing that the in vivo action of IGF-I is mimicked by the naturally occurring N-terminal tripeptide of mature IGF-I, GPE. This application is based on the premise that processing of IGF-I, resulting in GPE and des-(1-3)-IGF-I, provides the brain with two biologically active peptides that both work to protect central function. Successful completion of four objectives will allow us to define the anti-inflammatory role of GPE and des-(1-3)-IGF-I within the CNS. Objective 1 will characterize the ability of supplemental GPE alone or with des-(1-3)-IGF-I, both given icv, to block both sickness and depressive-like behaviors. This model mimics the ability of exercise to elevate IGF-I in the brain. Peripherally-initiated inflammatory episodes, initiated by lipopolysaccharide given i.p., will be used to induce brain cytokine expression and signaling. Transient sickness behavior will be quantified using well established measures of sickness (decreased activity and rearing, reduced social investigation and body weight loss). Depressive-like behavior will be determined after mice have recovered from sickness behavior using two already validated end-points, duration of immobility in the forced-swim and the tail-suspension tests. Objective 2 is critical as it will determine the mode of action by which GPE and des-(1-3)-IGF-I act within the brain to prevent pro-inflammatory cytokine-dependent behavioral changes. Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling, will be quantified following icv. treatment with GPE or des-(1-3)-IGF-I to test our hypothesis that these two peptides use distinct mechanisms within the brain to block sickness and depressive-like behaviors. Objective 3 will use in vitro models to clearly determine the cell(s) within the central nervous system that bind and respond to des-(1-3)-IGF-I and GPE. The fourth and last objective will use in vitro and ex vivo models to define the mechanisms involved in the central responses elicited by des-(1-3)-IGF-I and GPE to antagonize an inflammatory episode. The responses of the three major cell types of the CNS (neurons, microglia and astrocytes) and ex vivo organotypic slice cultures will be compared to confirm that the modus operandi of GPE and des-(1-3)-IGF-I that are utilized in vivo can be modeled in controlled systems. Techniques that are needed to successfully complete these objectives have been developed. Experiments in this application are critical to understand how a major endogenous hormone, that until now has been known mainly for its growth promoting actions, functions in the brain to antagonize clinically-important behaviors that occur during inflammation."

With the potential to diminish the negative impact of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain, the IGF system has independently been shown to decrease a variety of cytokine-dependent psychopathologies, including cognitive dysfunction, chronic pain, depression, and sickness behavior. A major strength of this application is the use of a multidisciplinary approach to integrate the fields of immunology, behavior and endocrinology to learn how a physiologically-relevant growth factor and cytokines interact to maintain and promote function of the brain and increase quality of life."

"Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section Major depression is a subjective emotional state resulting in decreased mood, loss of ability to cope with stressful life events and reduced ability to experience pleasure. The incidence of major depression is increasing worldwide, and a significant proportion of patients suffering from major depression have an underlying comorbid condition of an activated innate immune system. Clinical data have already shown that symptoms of depressed mood are elicited by cytokine administration. Also, preclinical models show that physiological stressors, including psychological stress or infection, induce the production of inflammatory cytokines followed by depression-like behaviors. It is now generally accepted that symptoms of depression are associated with systemic inflammation. Negative affect, anhedonia and fatigue are all symptoms of depression that are induced by inflammatory events. However, these criteria possess distinct psychopathological constructs, suggesting discrete inflammation-dependent pathways responsible for specific symptoms. To date, the biological underpinnings of these symptom-dependent pathways have eluded characterization. The experiments in this proposal will build on our discovery that tryptophan is metabolized through divergent indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-dependent pathways that are uniquely responsible for deficits in motivated behavior (anhedonia and fatigue) and induction of negative affect (helplessness/despair). Three overlapping areas will be investigated to define the role of tryptophan metabolism in specific symptoms of depression. In Aim 1, we will use preclinical genetic and pharmacological Ido floxed mouse models to characterize the tryptophan metabolizing pathways necessary for negative affect. In Aim 2, floxed mice will then be used to clarify the role of tryptophan metabolism in motivated behaviors. In Aim 3, we will define the regulation of tryptophan metabolism within specific brain regions relative to specific symptoms of depression, focusing on the striatum and hippocampus. These exciting and novel experiments will be the first to integrate neuroimmune regulation of tryptophan metabolism with specific symptoms of major depression. This effort is the first step toward the development of new targets to treat depression based on symptomology."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this research is to understand neural mechanisms and information processing principles involved in sensory acquisition. Humans and other animals receive a constant barrage of sensory input from the environment. The nervous system must continuously process this massive amount of data to extract useful information and to suppress irrelevant background noise. This project investigates mechanisms of sensory acquisition using the electric sense of weakly electric fish as a model system. These animals are able to sense their surroundings by detecting modulations in a weak (millivolt-level) self-generated electric field. This ability, referred to as electrolocation, enables them to hunt and navigate in the dark. Electrosensory signals arising from small aquatic prey are much weaker than many of the background signals experienced by the animal. The research proposed here helps elucidate how the nervous system solves this challenging information processing problem. This study uses a combination of experimental and modeling approaches to investigate how the electrosensory system extracts behaviorally relevant signals from the background. Neurophysiological recordings from electrosensory afferent nerve fibers are used to guide the development of an accurate model of afferent response dynamics. Recordings of the physical stimulus (transdermal voltage) in free-swimming fish are used to characterize the amplitude and spectral properties of the background. Information processing principles are explored in an empirically constrained model of electrosensory processing in three topographic maps of the hindbrain electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL). Each of the three maps is known to have unique spatial and temporal filtering properties. The modeling framework is used to quantitatively evaluate the contributions of afferent convergence and spatiotemporal filtering in the ELL maps to the enhancement of the signal and the suppression of the background."
"DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract): The long-term objective of this research is to gain a better understanding of neural mechanisms and information processing principles involved in sensory acquisition in vertebrate sensory systems. The aspects of sensory processing under investigation are those in which the nervous system actively influences the quality and content of incoming sensory data to enhance signals of interest and to suppress unwanted background. Two related aspects of sensory acquisition are studied in the active electrosensory system of weakly electric fish: (1) the adaptive control of signal processing properties in sensory pathways, and (2) the motor control of peripheral sensory receptor structures. Certain fish have the ability to sense their surroundings by detecting extremely weak self-generated electric fields. This ability, referred to as electrolocation, enables them to hunt and navigate in the absence of visual cues. One thrust of this project is to understand how neural circuitry in the hindbrain electrosensory nucleus, the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL), helps weakly electric fish extract and enhance signals of behavioral relevance. In particular, this study seeks to characterize adaptive signal processing mechanisms and principles associated with descending pathways to the ELL. A second thrust involves the motor control aspects of electrosensory acquisition associated with the movement strategies used by weakly electric fish when performing a natural electrosensory task. These issues are addressed using a combination of approaches: 1) infrared video recording studies of prey capture behavior in weakly electric fish; 2) neurophysiological recordings from the ELL and associated neural circuitry; 3) biologically-based neural models and computer simulations of ELL signal processing; 4) application of adaptive signal processing and noise suppression concepts from engineering. This research is intended to lead to a better understanding of general principles of sensory acquisition that enable animals, including humans, to efficiently obtain and process information about their environment."
"The long-term objective of this research is to gain an understanding of neural mechanisms and information processing principles involved in sensory acquisition in vertebrate sensory systems. The research is focused on those aspects of sensory processing in which the nervous system actively influences the content and quality of incoming sensory information. In general, the neural mechanisms under investigation fall into two categories, those involved in the control of filtering properties in sensory processing pathways (adaptive signal processing aspects) and those involved in the active positioning of peripheral sensory structures (motor control aspects). The research proposed here will investigate both adaptive signal processing and motor control aspects of sensory acquisition in the electrosensory system of the weakly electric fish, Apteronotus leptorhyncus (brown ghost knife fish). Adaptive signal processing studies will explore the neural mechanisms involved in the descending modulation of stimulus filtering properties in the first-order electrosensory nucleus (the electrosensory lateral line lobe, or ELL). Motor control studies will quantify the behavioral strategy use by these fish when carrying out electrosensory discrimination tasks. The research approach relies heavily on computer modeling and simulation techniques to elucidate underlying neural mechanisms. Biologically-detailed computer simulations of electrosensory processing will be constructed, including: (1) finite-element simulations of peripheral electrical image formation, (2) time-domain models of primary afferent response dynamics, (3) compartmental models of ELL pyramidal cells, and (4) network models of electrosensory processing in the ELL. In vivo single-unit recordings from primary afferents and first-order electrosensory neurons will be carried out to guide and constrain the development of the computer models. These experiments will involve quantifying the threshold, gain, and time-domain response properties of primary afferents and the gain and spatiotemporal tuning properties of pyramidal cells in the ELL. The behavior of weakly electric fish performing electrosensory discrimination tasks will be recorded on videotape and subsequently analyzed to extract information about the control of body position and velocity during sensory acquisition. Spatiotemporal patterns of afferent activation will be reconstructed and compared with the spatiotemporal tuning properties of first-order electrosensory neurons. Stochastic optimal estimation theory will be used to test the hypothesis that the stimulus filtering accomplished by the primary afferents and first-order electrosensory neurons is near-optimal for extracting estimates of the size and location of nearby objects from the electrical images generated on the fish's body surface."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The interaction between aerobic exercise and drug abuse is relatively unexplored. It deserves attention because recent data suggest neuroadaptations from exercise promote learning in circuits that overlap with drug abuse. The hippocampus is an important point of intersection because it is a major locus for change from aerobic exercise and it plays a central role in contextual conditioning. Specifically, contextual cues paired with drugs trigger emotional responses related to craving and relapse. The long-term goal of this research program is to identify molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the influence of exercise on drug-related behaviors in mice. The overall objective of this application is to develop a mouse model to study the effects of wheel running exercise on extinction of cocaine conditioned place preference, and to test one hypothesized mechanism for how exercise can influence Pavlovian drug associations. The central hypothesis is that new neurons from exercise can cause drug associations to persist if the drug is administered at a critical period in the development of the new neurons when they are preferentially recruited into learning networks. This is supported by the Preliminary Studies that show resistance to extinction of conditioned place preference for cocaine in runners as compared to sedentary animals after re-exposure to cocaine in context. The objective of this application will be accomplished by pursuing two specific aims. Aim 1 is to identify the impact of aerobic exercise on extinction of conditioned place preference for cocaine. Based on Preliminary Studies, the working hypothesis is that exercise will either facilitate or delay extinction of conditioned place preference depending on whether drug exposure occurs before or after exercise training, in parallel with increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. To accomplish this aim, the order of conditioning and exercise treatments will be manipulated, and then conditioned place preference will be measured repeatedly until extinction. Animals will be injected with BrdU to label dividing cells, and the number of BrdU cells co-labeled with neuronal nuclear marker, NeuN, in the granule layer of the dentate gyrus will be used to measure neurogenesis. Aim 2 is to determine the extent to which new neurons from exercise causally contribute to persistence of conditioned place preference for cocaine. Based on Preliminary Studies, the working hypothesis is that new neurons from exercise will function to enhance Pavlovian conditioning. This hypothesis will be directly tested by reducing neurogenesis using 2 separate methods, a transgenic mouse model and focal gamma irradiation, to determine whether new neurons are required for exercise to delay extinction of place preference. The extent to which new neurons are preferentially recruited into circuits involved in cocaine conditioning will also be determined by measuring the proportion of BrdU positive versus negative cells expressing c-Fos in response to the preference test. The project will discover mechanisms for interactions between exercise and drug abuse. This will be useful for evaluating the benefits or risks of incorporating exercise in treatment of drug abuse. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will discover the impact of enhanced neuroplasticity from aerobic exercise on extinction of cocaine conditioned behavior in a mouse model. The project will provide useful evidence for evaluating the benefits or risks of incorporating exercise in treatment of drug abuse."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely accepted that genes interact with environment to affect brain function and behavior. Exercise is a potent environmental factor with known benefits for physical health such as strength and stamina. The recent discovery that exercise can also enhance cognitive performance has generated much enthusiasm and interest, but mechanisms are far less understood. A growing body of evidence in rodent animal models suggests that exercise is a natural generator of neural plasticity. One example is growth of new neurons in the hippocampus, which is strongly regulated by exercise along with many other changes (e.g., trophic factors, growth factors, capillaries). Harnessing mechanisms of the natural generator could be useful for treating a wide range of neurological problems such as cognitive aging, neurodegenerative disease, stroke, or head trauma. One approach to find a mechanism is to systematically block changes in each hypothesized substrate (e.g., new neurons). Another is unbiased exploration of genetic mechanisms. We propose both. Preliminary data suggest that exercise induced changes in hippocampal neurogenesis and learning vary depending on genotype in mice. Aims 1 and 2 are to identify sets of genotypes that display larger versus smaller benefits. This crucial information will be contributed to a database of phenotypic and genetic information on these strains, and used in the future to identify mechanisms for cognitive benefits of exercise at multiple levels of biological organization from genes to physiology to behavior. In addition to laying the groundwork for the genetic analysis, we also propose an innovative method in aim 3 to reduce neurogenesis in exercising mice, focal gamma radiation, to directly test the hypothesis that new neurons are required for enhanced learning from exercise in predisposed genotypes. For this, we propose to use the genotype C57BL/6J, as proof of principal, because a strong correlation between exercise, neurogenesis, and learning is well established for this strain."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely accepted that genes interact with environment to affect brain function and behavior. Exercise is a potent environmental factor with known benefits for physical health such as strength and stamina. The recent discovery that exercise can also enhance cognitive performance has generated much enthusiasm and interest, but mechanisms are far less understood. A growing body of evidence in rodent animal models suggests that exercise is a natural generator of neural plasticity. One example is growth of new neurons in the hippocampus, which is strongly regulated by exercise along with many other changes (e.g., trophic factors, growth factors, capillaries). Harnessing mechanisms of the natural generator could be useful for treating a wide range of neurological problems such as cognitive aging, neurodegenerative disease, stroke, or head trauma. One approach to find a mechanism is to systematically block changes in each hypothesized substrate (e.g., new neurons). Another is unbiased exploration of genetic mechanisms. We propose both. Preliminary data suggest that exercise induced changes in hippocampal neurogenesis and learning vary depending on genotype in mice. Aims 1 and 2 are to identify sets of genotypes that display larger versus smaller benefits. This crucial information will be contributed to a database of phenotypic and genetic information on these strains, and used in the future to identify mechanisms for cognitive benefits of exercise at multiple levels of biological organization from genes to physiology to behavior. In addition to laying the groundwork for the genetic analysis, we also propose an innovative method in aim 3 to reduce neurogenesis in exercising mice, focal gamma radiation, to directly test the hypothesis that new neurons are required for enhanced learning from exercise in predisposed genotypes. For this, we propose to use the genotype C57BL/6J, as proof of principal, because a strong correlation between exercise, neurogenesis, and learning is well established for this strain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to discover mechanisms for pro cognitive effects of exercise at multiple levels of biological organization from genes to physiology to behavior."
"An aging study is proposed to test the relationship between conscientiousness and the social environmental factors and health- related behaviors that contribute to health and longevity. There is accumulating evidence that conscientiousness plays a significant role in the health process through its effect on health behaviors, such as tobacco and alcohol consumption (Caspi, Begg, Dickson, Harrington, Langley, Moffitt, & Silva, 1997) and social environmental factors, such as divorce and social support (Tucker, Kressin, Spiro, & Ruscio, 1998; Tucker, Schwartz, Clark, & Friedman, 1999). Despite these initial links to health, the role of conscientiousness in the health process has not been systematically studied, nor have the effects of aging on the relation between conscientiousness and health been investigated. Preliminary data are reported which suggest that a comprehensive model of conscientiousness is linked to many of the health behaviors and social environmental factors that contribute to health and longevity . The proposed research has three aims to be tested in a representative sample of young, middle-aged, and older participants. The first aim is to use a multi-method, comprehensive assessment model of conscientiousness to predict the social environmental and health-behavior factors known to affect health. It is predicted that certain facets of conscientiousness, such as impulse control, will predict specific health behaviors, such as drug consumption, more precisely than other facets of conscientiousness. The second aim is to test how age affects the relationships among conscientiousness, health-related behaviors, and social environmental factors. It is predicted that the relationship between specific facets of conscientiousness and social environmental and health-behavior factors will diminish with age and that individuals who maintain consistently low levels of conscientiousness into middle and old age will show greater lifetime accumulation of behavioral risk factors that undermine longevity, such as more years of alcohol and tobacco use, fewer children, and fewer years of physical activity. The third aim is to establish the foundation for an ongoing longitudinal study of the relationship between conscientiousness and social environmental and health behavior factors that affect health across the life course."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health-related behaviors are now considered one of the primary reasons for poor health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and premature mortality (McGinnis & Foege, 1993). One of the keys to improving health is identifying the antecedents to health behaviors, which fall into the superordinate categories of individual differences, such as personality traits, and social environmental factors, such as low socioeconomic status (Adler & Mathews, 1994). At the time of our last grant submission, the personality trait of conscientiousness-individual differences in the propensity to be self-controlled, organized, planful, and norm following-had not been systematically integrated into research on the health process. With the support of grant R01AG21178 we initiated a program of research, including two longitudinal studies, to examine the role of conscientiousness in the health process. In the last five years we have shown that conscientiousness predicts all risky and preventative health behaviors that affect physical health and mortality. That conscientiousness also predicts many of the social environmental factors that contribute to positive health outcomes. And that conscientiousness, health behaviors, and social environmental factors are reciprocally related to one another over time. Based on this program of research, it is clear that conscientiousness plays a significant role in determining positive health outcomes across the life course, including old age. With this foundation of research in place, we propose to pursue 4 aims for the current competing renewal of R01AG21178: 1) test the effect of genetic polymorphisms on conscientiousness, health behaviors, social environmental factors and their associations, 2) extend the longitudinal studies to incorporate the effect of conscientiousness, health behaviors and social environmental factors on physical health and mortality, 3) continue our longitudinal research initiated as part of the grant into the interplay of conscientiousness, health behaviors, and social environmental factors over time, permitting us to test the predictive validity of conscientiousness in a prospective longitudinal design, and 4) determine the specific social cognitive, behavioral, and emotional mechanisms that explain the relation of conscientiousness to health."

One of the key psychological predictors of health-related behaviors is conscientiousness (the propensity to be self-controlled, organized, planful, and norm following). The proposed research will investigate the mechanisms that explain why conscientiousness affects poor health by examining the interplay of conscientiousness with social environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status, on health-related behaviors, physical health, and longevity. We will also investigate the genetic and environmental antecedents to conscientiousness."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite established Links to longevity, the role of conscientiousness in the health process has not been systematically studied, nor have the effects of aging on the relationship between conscientiousness and health been investigated. Two longitudinal studies are proposed to test the relationship between conscientiousness and the social environmental factors and health-related behaviors that contribute to health and longevity. Pilot data are reported which suggest that a comprehensive model of conscientiousness is linked to many of the health behaviors and social environmental factors that contribute to health and longevity. Also, data is presented showing significant increases in conscientiousness and decreases in risky health behaviors with age. Building on these initial findings, the proposed research has three aims. The first aim is to fully delineate the relationships among conscientiousness, health-related behaviors, and the social environmental factors that affect health and longevity using multiple methods. The second aim is to test how age affects the relationships among conscientiousness, health-related behaviors, and social environmental factors. The third aim is to perform follow-up assessments of two age-stratified samples in order to test the relationship between changes in conscientiousness and changes in the health behaviors and social environmental factors that contribute to better health. The proposed research is significant for four reasons. First, conscientiousness, through its relationship to health behaviors and social environmental factors, may be one of the most important, yet under-appreciated contributors to positive health outcomes across the life course. Second, the effect of age on the relationship of conscientiousness to these health factors is unknown and the proposed studies will provide the most definitive test of the effect of aging on these relationships. Third, increases in conscientiousness across the life course may facilitate even greater improvements in health behaviors and social environmental factors that, in turn, contribute to positive health outcomes. And fourth, this research will allow us to identify the social environmental factors that promote increases in conscientiousness and decreases in risky health behaviors."
"DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Abstract) In the past ten years, various strategies that use bispecific antibodies to redirect the activity to T cells against tumor cells have been developed. Despite the advance of several of these agents into clinical trials, there remain significant problems with the bispecific antibody approach. Chief among these problems has been the inability to sustain an active T cell infiltrate at the site of solid tumors. The overall goal of the proposed experiments is to sustain T cell activity at the site of the tumor and redirect the efficient lysis of tumor cells. Bispecific agents that target T cells to the high affinity folate receptor (FR), found on most ovarian carcinomas and some brain tumors, can be produced easily by attaching folate to any anti-T cell antibody of interest. This method will allow evaluation of the tumor-dependent T cell activating potential of various conjugates, including folate conjugates of antibodies to the T cell receptor/CD3 complex, CD28, and LFA-1. Multivalent ligation of these molecules on the surface of T cells stimulates full activation of T cells under normal physiological conditions. In contrast, ligation of the T cell molecule CTLA4 with its ligand B7 leads to T cell inactivation. Inhibition of the CTLA4:B7 interaction can sustain the activity of T cells. Based on these rationales the various folate/anti-T cell antibody conjugates will be tested alone and in combination with monovalent forms (scFv and Fab) of an anti-CTLA4 antibody. In Specific Aim 1, in vitro assays will measure T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity after incubation of T cells with folate/anti-TCR conjugates, anti-CTLA4 antibody fragments and FR tumor cells. In Specific Aim 2, mice treated in vivo with various antibody agents will be examined ex vivo for cytotoxicity by splenic T cells or peritoneal exudate cells and by immunohistochemical analysis of T cell infiltrates within tumors. The goal of this aim is to identify agents that optimally maintain activated T cells within the tumor. In Specific Aim 3, antibodies and/or folate-conjugates will be tested for their ability to eliminate FR+ tumors in three murine model systems: (a) immunologically defined 2C TCR/RAG mice transplanted with a human FR+ tumor; (b) immunocompetent mice transplanted with a syngeneic FR+ tumor; and (c) immunocompetent transgenic mice that develop endogenous FR+ brain tumors. Endpoints will include survival, tumor progression, and testing for tumor-specific memory by re-transplantation of the appropriate tumor."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Like antibodies, T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) recognize a huge diversity of molecular targets. The range of cancer related targets that T cells can recognize is even greater than what antibodies recognize, because intracellular proteins, such as transcription factors and other proteins that are modified in cancer, are processed and presented on the cell surface as peptide/MHC complexes that T cells recognize, whereas antibodies recognize only proteins that function on the cell surface. In addition, T cells have properties of active mobility that allow them to penetrate the blood brain barrier and migrate through solid tumors that antibodies will not readily penetrate. Phase I will test two ideas: (1) because iron strongly alters MRI signals, a clonal population of T cells loaded with iron nanoparticles can be used as an imaging agent in cancer, particularly brain tumors. Only tumor cells expressing a particular tumor associated peptide will be identified by the T cells. (2) Certain iron nanoparticles generate intense heat when exposed to alternating magnetic fields; this property can be used therapeutically. 'Suicide bomber' T cells loaded with iron nanoparticles will specifically bind to tumor cells. Once their presence in the tumor is confirmed by MRI, alternating magnetic fields can be applied to produce damage in the surrounding cells, generating heat shock proteins and tumor antigens that will instigate a stronger immune response. Phase II tests two ideas: (1) the immune response generated by heating intratumor iron will be greatly enhanced if combined with danger signals, such as CpG oligonucleotides, that increase antigen presentation in lymph nodes. (2) Both of these uses of iron loaded T cells, imaging and therapy, will be enhanced by transfecting T cells with genetically engineered T cell receptors with higher affinity for tumor associated epitopes. High affinity T cell receptors for a model tumor antigen have been generated by yeast display technology, and experiments will determine if these high affinity T cell receptors enhance the imaging and therapeutic potential of iron loaded T cells."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The issue of attention capture is of fundamental importance to understanding what we perceive and how we react when confronted with a salient, but previously unattended object or event. Two distinct, and almost entirely separate, literatures have examined this issue. One has measured implicit attention capture the effects of an unattended stimulus on performance of a primary task. Implicit capture studies determine whether attention capture has occurred by measuring whether or not the presence of a stimulus disrupts (or facilitates) performance on an attention-demanding primary task. Such studies address only the behavioral consequences of an irrelevant stimulus and do not systematically explore whether or not observers are aware of the capturing stimulus. The other literature measures explicit attention capture - the conscious awareness of a previously unanticipated stimulus. Both approaches are crucial to a complete understanding of capture in the laboratory and in the real world. However, in isolation, each literature has neglected critical aspects of capture. The proposed experiments use attention tasks developed in prior work on attention capture as well as several new paradigms in order to identify the factors that influence the explicit noticing of unexpected objects as well as subtle effects of irrelevant or unexpected events on behavior. In so doing, they address a number of open issues in both literatures. The studies focus on three main questions: (1) what role do expectations play in capture? (2) how does the nature of the critical object or event contribute to capture? and (3) how does engagement in a primary task contribute to capture? By varying the nature of the critical, unattended event, these studies will explore how capture is influenced by the behavioral relevance of the new object. Moreover, by varying the nature of the primary task and the degree of engagement required of subjects, these studies provide a more accurate picture of how attention capture operates in demanding and dynamic situations. Ideally, these studies will help to generalize results from simplified visual search tasks to more complex, real-world perception, thereby leading to a better understanding of the detection of important, but unexpected objects. By integrating approaches from both the implicit and explicit capture literatures, these studies may contribute to an improved understanding of both normal and damaged attentional processing (e.g., as in people with attention deficit disorder)."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are an estimated 1.5 million manual wheelchair users in the United States. ~70% of manual wheelchair users report shoulder pain, which is directly linked to further disability including difficulty performing activities of daily living, decreased physical activity, and reduced quality of life. Overall, any loss of upper limb function due to pain adversely impacts the independence and mobility of manual wheelchair users. Subsequently, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms that contribute to upper limb pathology in manual wheelchair users so that appropriate interventions can be developed to prevent or minimize the effect of pain on function and reduce the risk of long-term upper extremity disability. Lack of variability in spatiotemporal characteristics of movements has been suggested to be a contributing factor to the development of overuse injuries. Although there has been considerable research on shoulder pain and manual wheelchair users, those studies have not explored motor variability. Further, the majority of factors (e.g. gender and injury level) contributing to shoulder pain are not modifiable; however, preliminary data suggest that propulsion variability is potentially modifiable with training. Therefore, the innovation of this proposal is to explore the variability profile of wheelchair propulsion and whether or not it correlates with shoulder pain in manual wheelchair users. The goals of this project are (1) to quantify the amount and time-evolving structure of kinetic, kinematic and temporal variability in wheelchair propulsion as a function of functional level (paraplegia vs. tetraplegia), and (2) to determine existence of an association between variability in propulsion mechanics and shoulder pain in manual wheelchair users. Our aims will be addressed using a cross-sectional design whereby manual wheelchair users (paraplegics and tetraplegics, with and without pain) will propel their own wheelchair while their propulsion mechanics (kinematic, kinetic, and temporal outcome measures) are recorded. We will measure the amount and time-evolving structure of their propulsion mechanics utilizing novel and standard non-linear dynamical measures. Shoulder pain will be assessed using self-report and functional examination. We hypothesize that there will be significantly greater kinematic, kinetic and temporal variability in higher functioning (paraplegic) individuals. We additionally hypothesize that kinematic, kinetic and temporal variability in wheelchair propulsion will be negatively associated with shoulder pain. The information gained from this project will provide vital information supporting a future prospective investigation in a larger sample of manual wheelchair users that would address whether motor variability is a predictor of should pain. . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal has considerable importance for public health as the results will lead to a better understanding of correlates of shoulder pain in manual wheelchair users by taking the novel approach of examining motor variability in wheelchair propulsion mechanics. The project will introduce new tools and methodologies to the study of wheelchair propulsion and shoulder pain. Further, the results may be used to further determine the association between motor variability and shoulder pain in manual wheelchair users."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective navigation through adult life, including workplace competence and managing family health, is critically dependent upon the ability to understand and use text. Depending on the text and task demands, reading can depend on both working memory / executive control processes and knowledge, as well as skill in directing attention to the various processing demands of language comprehension and memory. Aging normatively brings both declines in working memory and executive control, but growth in knowledge and verbal ability, so that one might expect the nature of language processing to change through the life span. In fact, there is considerable evidence showing that memory for text declines with aging, however, there is considerable variability in this effect and age differences can depend on characteristics of the text, the task, and the reader. The proposed research will examine the fundamental mechanisms of adult language processing in terms of a model of self-regulated language processing (Stine-Morrow, Miller, & Hertzog, 2006) suggesting that the representation the content given directly by the text (the 'textbase') and the representation of the situation suggested by the discourse (the 'situation model') are independently regulated. Readers are assumed to regulate the construction of this representation both in the way in which they engage attentional resources to understand particular texts (Stine-Morrow, Miller, Gagne, & Hertzog, 2008) and in the way in which they select different information sources (Pirolli & Card, 1999; Fu & Pirolli, 2007). The fidelity to which the textbase and situational representations are constructed depends, in part, on the cognitive and socioemotional goals of the reader, the constellation of abilities that underpin language processing, and the availability of texts and other resources compatible with readers' abilities, interests, and knowledge. A series of studies is proposed to (a) test the hypothesis that aging brings divergence in textbase and situation model processing, using novel paradigms that use common metrics, (b) test the notion that age-related decreases in working memory create a tendency to underspecify the textbase representation and examine conditions that might mitigate against this effect, (c) test the idea that older adults have specific deficits with managing situational representations of multiple characters and examine text engineering solutions to this problem that can be easily implemented in e-text, and (d) examine age differences in the use of multiple (text) sources to optimize learning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Workplace competence, managing family health, and maintaining social communication all hinge on effective language understanding and memory. There is now a considerable literature suggesting that in certain respects, language understanding and memory can become compromised as a function of normal, healthy aging. It is critical that we understand the basic cognitive mechanisms underlying age-related change in language processing so that we can grapple with the practical problems associated with these changes (e.g., process-based models of health literacy, reading as a form of intellectual engagement to maintain cognitive vitality through the life span)."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout the life span, reading is a requisite skill for performing work, attending to personal needs, and participating in society on a number of levels from filing tax returns to helping children navigate through an educational system to maintaining correspondence. In addition, reading enables entry into new worlds allowing continued growth of the self. Not only is the current cohort of older adults disproportionately disadvantaged in literacy skills, but also age-graded changes in processing capacity make some aspects of reading more difficult. This proposal is a request for a continuation of our project examining adult age differences in resource allocation during reading and the impact of these differences on subsequent comprehension and memory performance. We build on our earlier work by integrating our resource allocation approach with the literature on (cognitive and affective) self-regulation, so as to consider the implications of age-graded reductions in processing capacity, increased reliance on knowledge, and increased role of social and emotional goals for reading. A theoretical framework is developed in which self regulation in reading is conceptualized as arising from a set of negative feedback loops functioning in the context of goals and knowledge of the individual reader. An adult developmental model is adopted in which aging is assumed to engender decreases in fluid ability (reducing the efficiency of language computations), increases in crystallized knowledge (thereby increasing reliance on preexisting knowledge), and a shift in goals which give relatively more weight to social-emotional goals relative to cognitive ones. Within this cognitive developmental framework, we propose a series of experiments that explore the conditions under which self-regulation in reading is compromised by resource demands and when it may be used in a compensatory fashion. We specifically explore how self-regulation in reading is affected by (1) challenges created by illegible orthography, complex syntax, and informational density (Series I, II, & III), (2) the availability of background knowledge (Series IV), and (3) social and affective goals (Series V)."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The engagement hypothesis of cognitive aging suggests that age-related declines in intellectual functioning may to some extent be buffered by a lifestyle marked by social and intellectual engagement. Evidence for this idea, however, is primarily based on correlation data, which is subject to other interpretations, making it unclear whether engagement enhances cognitive function - or whether more intellectually capable individuals are prone to engagement. Training studies, in which cognitive and intellectual abilities are selectively trained, have been found to produce very little transfer to other abilities. Our goal in this project is to collect pilot data on the effects of a program of intellectual and social engagement, involving creative problem solving in a social/collaborative context. The Senior Odyssey project, developed in conjunction with the NIA-funded Roybal Center for Healthy Minds, is modeled on the Odyssey of the Mind program, developed for children and young adults over 20 years ago. In this program, participants work in teams to develop solutions to 'long-term' problems that require reflection and negotiated planning in the generation of a creative product (e.g., building a wood structure to hold a certain amount of weight or a vehicle to achieve a given transportation goal, or write and perform a play to illustrate a certain point), as well as to practice 'spontaneous' problems, which require fluency, flexibility, and originality in the context of social interaction. Senior volunteers will be randomly assigned to participate in the Senior Odyssey program or to selective cognitive training (i.e., speed training or memory training). The hypothesis to be tested is that the practice of basic cognitive skills (e.g., speed, memory, fluency, executive function) situated in the rich context of social interaction and goals for creative work will broadly enhance cognitive function as well as increase mindfulness, perceived control, and life satisfaction."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The engagement hypothesis suggests that age-related declines in cognition may to some extent be mitigated by a lifestyle marked by social and intellectual engagement. According to this view, contexts that require choice and decision-making in the face of ill-defined problems promote mental flexibility. Assuming that the environment provides rewards for effective solutions and creates opportunities for self-directed activity, complex environments continue to promote the allocation of resources toward intellectual activity, thereby expanding the repertoire of intellectual skills available to solve new problems, and to augment cognition and well-being in a variety of ways. Evidence for this idea, however, is primarily based on correlational data, which is subject to other interpretations, making it unclear whether engagement enhances cognitive function - or whether more intellectually capable individuals are prone to engagement. Training studies (e.g., the ACTIVE trials, Ball et al., 2002), in which cognitive and intellectual abilities are selectively trained, have been found to produce little or no transfer to other abilities; furthermore, studies of expertise (e.g., Morrow et al., 1994) show very narrow effects of experience. The current project is a translational research program, which attempts to bridge these two literatures by experimentally manipulating the substantive complexity of lifestyle for a six-month period. Participants will be randomly assigned to a program of engagement in which subjects participate in collaborative problem solving and literacy activities (our operationalization of a substantively complex environment), to a crossword puzzle / brainteaser control, or to a wait-list control. The engagement experience is modeled on an existing program, Odyssey of the Mind, developed for children and young adults (through college-aged); this existing social structure offers potential for scaling up so as to afford opportunities for intellectual and social stimulation for elders. A pretest and posttest battery of cognitive (e.g., speed, executive functions, fluency), dispositional measures indicating, self-regulatory effectiveness (e.g., mindfulness, self-efficacy), and activity (e.g., Hultsch Activity Scale, Day Reconstruction Method) will allow us to test the hypothesis that this form of engagement can augment cognitive function and self-regulatory capacity, in a context which may find ready translation into practice."
"Epidemiological evidence suggests that education and lifelong literacy have strong benefits forcognition and health in later adulthood. There is also increased understanding of reading asengendering a highly active mental state that is underpinned by a cascade of neural activity.Finally, studies contrasting illiterates and literates within carefully matched populations alsosuggest that literacy plays an important role in shaping mind and brain. Yet, behavioral researchon the benefits of leisure reading have been largely restricted to younger populations and toeffects in the domain of language processing. Relatively little is known about the more acuteeffects of habitual reading in adulthood or the causal mechanisms through which literacyengagement might impact cognitive health in late life Ç«Ù or the dispositional mechanisms throughwhich such engagement is sustained. We request funding to initiate a research program onliteracy-based interventions to enhance cognition and traits theorized to promote habitualengagement in intellectual challenge. In this exploratory (R21) project, we will examine whethera sustained period of reading engagement has measurable effects on cognition in lateradulthood. Reading represents a readily accessible form of mental stimulation, and yet hasreceived very little systematic study as a pathway to cognitive health. In this project, we willdevelop an electronic tablet app to present extended text materials and control activities (e.g.,puzzles), as well as to record selections and time allocation. This technology will enable us (1)to use an experimental design to contrast the effects of a program of reading engagementagainst a non-reading active control on behavioral targets among adults with relativelyunderdeveloped literacy practices, where (2) these targets are (a) core language processes(e.g., fluency, efficiency of word recognition, improved semantic processing), (b) domain-general processes (e.g., working memory, episodic memory, executive control), and (c) selecteddispositions (in particular, openness to experience). We will also explore (3) the extent to whichthe effects of acute literacy experience vary with pretest levels of literacy skills, literacyexperience, and dispositional traits. This project will pave the way for a more systematic study ofthe long-term effects of literacy on cognitive health and its underlying mechanisms."
"Understanding how auditory information is processed in the cochlear complex is essential for developing diagnostic tools to evaluate the ascending auditory system and for determining what information must be provided by cochlear prosthesis. The cochlear nuclear complex is the first locus of auditory information processing after sound is transduced in the cochlea, and in the cochlear nuclei information carried by auditory nerve fibers is divided into parallel ascending pathways. A number of psychoacoustic experiments have pointed to the cochlear nuclei as the site of a process that reduces the information available for sound localization shortly after the onset of a sound and contributes to the precedence effect. In vitro studies have suggested that tuberculoventral neurons, which project from the dorsal (DCN) to the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN), contribute to the reduction in information. Recently, in vivo findings showed that the tuberculoventral neurons mediate both a rapid and a slower inhibition. The rapid inhibition significantly decreased the response at the onset of a sound and the slower inhibition reduced the availability of information just after the onset. Although the rapid inhibition can suppress onset transients and the slower inhibition can contribute to the precedence effect, the precise functions of these two inhibitory inputs are unknown. Determining the functions of this intrinsic circuitry is central to understanding the processing of information in the ventral cochlear nucleus. The specific aims of this study are to determine how the rapid and the slower inhibitory inputs modulate the responses of VCN neurons to stimuli used in psychoacoustic studies on sound localization, to identify precisely the neural circuits that provide and control both the rapid and the slower inhibition, to characterize physiologically the tuberculoventral neurons, and to begin investigating the pharmacology that underlies the two changes in response. The specific aims will be accomplished using extracellular, single unit recordings in ketamine- anesthetized chinchillas. The recordings from VCN neurons will be made before and after injections of lidocaine are made at various locations and depths within the DCN to inactivate different components of the neural circuits projecting to the VCN. Tuberculoventral neurons will be identified by electrical stimulation of the tuberculoventral tract, and their responses to tones, clicks and noise will be characterized."
