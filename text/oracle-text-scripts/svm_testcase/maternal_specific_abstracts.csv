"The long-term objective of this research proposal is to explore the molecular basis of the regulation of embryonic implantation by calcitonin (CT), a peptide hormone that regulates calcium homeostasis. The expression of CT is induced in the glandular epithelium of rat uterus in the preimplantation phase of gestation and is switched off once implantation is completed. CT expression in human endometrium is restricted to the mid- secretory phase (days 19-24) of the menstrual cycle, with closely overlaps with the putative window of implantation. These findings suggest that CT may function as an important regulatory signal in the uterus during implantation. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1. To determine the functional event(s) regulated by CT during implantation. Administration of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), targeted against CT mRNA, into the preimplantation phase uterus results in marked suppression of the steady-state level of uterine CT mRNA. This intervention is also accompanied by a severe reduction in the number of implanted embryos. These results suggest that the impairment of implantation could be a direct phenotypic consequence of the blockade of CT gene expression by the antisense ODN. The effect of antisense ODN-induced CT deficiency on (a) uterine receptivity and (b) the ability of the embryo to implant will be examined by embryo transfer experiments. 2. To elucidate the signal transduction pathway(s) of CT in transformed human endometrial cell line Ishikawa and in primary cultures of human endometrial epithelial cells. CT acts on target cells through specific cell surface receptors. The expression of the CT receptor is also markedly elevated in the preimplantation endometrial epithelium. The second messenger pathways that are activated by CT via its receptor will be investigated in Ishikawa and primary cultures of endometrial epithelial cells. 3. To identify the genes that mediate the cellular actions of CT. CT stimulates the expression of c-fos mRNA while it inhibits the expression of osteopontin mRNA in human endometrial cells. To further understand how CT influences the embryo-uterine interactions, additional genes whose expression in the target cells is modulated in response to this hormone will be identified by subtractive cloning and their spatio-temporal expression in human endometrium during the menstrual cycle will be determine. The proposed study will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the chain of events that link the transient expression of CT in the uterine glands to the control of embryo-endometrial interactions during implantation."
"The long-term goal of this proposal is to explore how the steroid hormone estrogen (E) regulates growth and differentiation processes in the endometrium during early pregnancy (preimplantation period), which lead to acquisition of the receptive state that allows blastocyst implantation. E exerts its cellular effects by regulating the expression of specific target genes. The identity, profile of expression, and function of the E-regulated genes at various stages of the reproductive cycle and pregnancy, however, remain largely unknown. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1. Isolate and identify genes that are regulated in response to nidatory E in rat uterus during delayed implantation. The messenger RNA differential display method will be used to isolate and identify the cDNAs representing mRNAs whose expression is induced or repressed in rat uterus in response to an implantation-inducing dose of E. To determine whether the newly identified E-regulated genes are potential modulators of implantation, their spatio-temporal expression in rat uterus during early pregnancy will be analyzed by Northern blotting, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. 2. Assess the functional roles of the newly identified cDNAs in implantation. A recently developed antisense technology will be used to regulate specific gene expression in intact rat uterus. This will involve administration of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeted against mRNA transcript of each candidate gene into the preimplantation uterus to suppress the steady state level of that mRNA . If this intervention also leads to an impairment in implantation, it will allow the establishment of a functional link between this gene and the implantation process. 3. Analyze the function of a novel E-regulated gene, ERG1, in early pregnancy. A novel gene (ERG1) that is tightly regulated by E in two key reproductive tissues, the uterus and oviduct, has recently been isolated. ERG1 is expressed in the surface epithelium of the uterus in a highly stage-specific manner during the ovarian cycle and early pregnancy. To determine the functional role of ERG1 during early pregnancy, mice harboring a targeted germ line mutation of ERG1 will be developed and analyzed for potential reproductive phenotypes, such as impairment in embryo transport through the oviduct, defects in epithelial cell morphology and function, and lack of uterine receptivity for implantation. The proposed research will help us to identify molecules that mediate E regulation of critical events during early pregnancy."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The steroid hormone progesterone (P) profoundly influences the function of the uterus during establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. The cellular actions of P are mediated through intracellular progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms, PR-A and PR-B, which are well-known transcription factors. It is postulated that hormone-occupied PR triggers the expression of specific gene networks in different cell types within the uterus and the products of these genes mediate the hormonal effects. The long-term goal of this proposal is to identify and functionally characterize the PR-regulated pathways, which are critical mediators of P response within the uterus during early pregnancy. The specific aims of this study are to: 1. Analyze PR isoform-specific regulation and expression of DNA microarray-derived genes in the preimplantation mouse uterus. Oligonucleotide microarrays were utilized to identify several genes whose expression is markedly down regulated in pregnant uterus at the time of implantation in response to a PR antagonist. The PR isoform-specific gene knock-out (KO) mouse models, PRAKO and PRBKO, will be employed to identify the genes that are potentially important for implantation. The spatio-temporal expression of these genes in the pregnant uterus will be analyzed. 2. Determine the functional roles of microarray-derived genes in the preimplantation uterus. Using a newly developed methodology, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against mRNA transcripts of selected candidate genes will be administered into the preimplantation uterus to block specific gene expression during implantation. The functional effects of this intervention will be determined. In preliminary studies, antisense ODN-induced blockade of the expression of Irgl in the surface epithelium results in a severe impairment of implantation. The molecular target(s) of Irgl in the pregnant uterus will be identified by yeast two-hybrid approach. 3. Investigate the functional role of the PR-regulated protease inhibitor p12 in the decidual uterus, p12 is a serine protease inhibitor induced by P during trophoblast invasion and decidualization. The target protease(s) of p12 in the pregnant uterus will be identified by in vitro protein interaction methods and proteomics. Additionally, a p12 KO mouse will be developed and analyzed for potential reproductive defects. The proposed study will help us to identify molecules that are critical mediators of P regulation of embryo-uterine interactions during early pregnancy."
"The overall goal of this proposal is to analyze the functional role of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2), apleiotropic signaling molecule, and its downstream pathways in the control of uterine function duringimplantation. Our recent studies revealed that mice deficient in uterine BMP2 are infertile and exhibit asevere defect in stromal decidualization, a prerequisite for successful pregnancy. We also found that siRNAmediateddownregulation of BMP2 expression in primary cultures of stromal cells isolated from pregnantmouse uterus efficiently blocked the differentiation process. To analyze the role of BMP2 duringdecidualization, we formulated the following specific aims: 1. Analyze the mechanisms by which the BMP2signaling pathway controls stromal differentiation. Using microarray-based gene expression profiling, weidentifed potential downstream targets of BMP2 in the uterus during decidualization. We will evaluate thefunctional contribution of selected BMP2 target genes in stromal cell differentiation by siRNA-mediatedblockade of their expression and elucidate the signaling pathways of BMP2 in primary stromal cultures. 2.Investigate the function of Wnt 4 in murine uterine function. We identified Wnt 4 as a downstream target ofBMP2 regulation in stromal cells undergoing decidualization. Attenuation of Wnt 4 expression by siRNAsgreatly reduced stromal differentiation in vitro, suggesting that it is a candidate mediator of BMP2-induceddecidualization. We will generate a conditional knockout of Wnt 4 to confirm our in vitro findings, and toanalyze the functional consequences of this loss-of-function mutation during implantation. 3. Investigate thefunction of the BMP2 pathway in human decidualization. The expression of BMP2 is markedly induced inhuman endometrial stromal cells undergoing decidualization in vitro in response to steroid hormones andcAMP. Addition of exogenous BMP2 to these cultures also led to a robust enhancement of Wnt 4 expressionand stimulated the differentiation process. We will evaluate the role of Wnt 4 in human stromal celldifferentiation and identify additional gene pathways mediating BMP2 function in human stromal cells usingmicroarray analysis. Of particular interest would be the factors regulated by BMP2 in both mouse and humanendometrium. Collectively, the proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that BMP2 and its downstreamsignaling pathways play critical and conserved roles during decidualization and implantation."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Concerted actions of the ovarian steroid hormones estrogen (E) and progesterone (P), acting via their cognate receptors in uterine epithelial and stromal compartments, determine the maternal competency for embryo implantation. A clear understanding of the molecular pathways via which these hormone receptors regulate uterine functions during the reproductive cycle and pregnancy would require a definition of their cell type-specific roles in the uterus. Until recently, it was thought that estrogen receptor alpha (ER? present in the epithelial cells drives the E-induced proliferation of these cells during the reproductive cycle. Generation of a conditional knockout of ER? in uterine epithelium has revealed the surprising fact that E-induced proliferation of uterine epithelial cells is independen of the epithelial ER?. This finding has led to the hypothesis that E may act via the stromal ER? to control uterine epithelial proliferation by paracrine mechanisms. To test this new paradigm, it is necessary to create a conditional knockout mouse model in which ER? is deleted specifically in the uterine stromal cells. A major objective of this R21 application is to develop the Hand2-Cre transgenic mice in which Cre recombinase expression, under the control of an 11-kb regulatory region of the Hand2 gene, will be induced exclusively in the uterine stromal cells in response to P, thereby ablating the 'floxed' ER? gene in these cells. This mouse model will provide novel insights into the role of ER? in directing stromal-epithelial dialogue during the establishment of pregnancy and would serve as an extremely valuable tool for researchers in the field of uterine biology."
"The long-term goal of this proposal is to explore how the nuclear receptors of thyroid hormones regulate the expression of specific cellular genes. There are two major types of thyroid hormone receptors, TRalpha and TRbeta. Hormone-free TRs actively silence transcription of genes bearing TR-response elements. Ligand binding to the receptor triggers the release of silencing and leads to the activation of target gene expression. Recent studies indicate that a corepressor, NCoR, associates with unliganded TR to critically regulate its repression function. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1. Define the polypeptide constituents of a native corepressor complex containing NCoR. TRBETA binds to a multiprotein complex containing the corepressor NCoR, which is essential for receptor-mediated silencing in HeLa nuclear extracts. The NCoR complex that interacts with TRBETA will be isolated by protein affinity or immunoaffinity methods and its polypeptide constituents will be identified. 2. Identify the silencing domains of NCoR and mSin3A that participate in TR-mediated repression in an in vitro transcription system and investigate their mechanisms of action. NCoR is associated with another corepressor, mSin3A, in HeLa extracts, raising the possibility that mSin3A is also involved in the repression process. Site-directed mutagenesis will be performed to identify the amino acid residues in NCoR that mediate its interaction with mSin3A. These mutant NCoRs will be used to determine the role of mSin3A in TR-mediated silencing. 3. Analyze the mechanism by which the NCoR-mSin3A complex inhibits the initiation of basal transcription by the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Recent studies suggested that the NCoR-mSin3 corepressor complex silences transcription by recruiting a histone deacetylase (HDAC) that creates a repressive chromatin structure. However, trichostatin A, an inhibitor of HDAC, failed to inhibit TR-mediated silencing in HeLa nuclear extracts. Transcriptional repression by the corepressor complex may therefore proceed through an alternative, HDAC-independent pathway. Interestingly, the NCoR-mSin3 complex interacts with the basal initiation factor TFIIB. The hypothesis that a component(s) of the transcription initiation complex could be a direct target of repression by the corepressors will be tested by analyzing the functional consequences of interactions between the NCoR complex and the components of the basal transcription machinery. The proposed research will develop a better understanding of the mechanisms that determine the gene regulatory activity of TR in normal cellular physiology and the molecular basis of abnormalities in the TR signaling pathway in human disease states such as GRTH."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to investigate the functional role of the lipid mediators generated by the 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) enzymes in the control of uterine function during implantation. The 12/15-LOX catalyzes the stereo-specific oxygenation of the 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, arachidonic acid and linoleic acid, into a complex series of derivatives, HETEs and HODES. Recent studies, using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays, revealed that progesterone markedly induces the synthesis of mRNAs encoding the 12/15-LOX family members, leukocyte-12/15-LOX and epidermal-12/15-LOX, in the surface epithelium of pregnant uterus precisely at the time of implantation. Administration of a LOX-specific inhibitor markedly inhibited steroid hormone-regulated vascular permeability during delayed implantation in mice, indicating an important role of these enzymes in creating a receptive uterus. The major goals of this proposal are to: 1. Identify the gene networks that mediate the physiological effects of these lipid metabolites in the uterus during implantation. The 12/15-LOX-regulated gene pathways will be identified by DNA microarray. The spatio-temporal expression of these genes in the peri-implantation uterus will be analyzed and their function will be determined by a newly developed antisense oligonucleotide strategy. 2. Investigate the role of PPARgamma in the 12/15-LOX signaling pathway during implantation. The 12/15-LOX-derived metabolites of arachidonic or linoleic acid activate gene transcription by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) in cell-based assays. PPARgamma expression is also induced in the uterus in the peri-implantation period. We will test whether PPARgamma is indeed the endogenous receptor for the 12/15-LOX-derived metabolites in the peri-implantation uterus and identify its target genes in this tissue. The role of PPARgamma will be further investigated by generating a conditional knockout of its gene in the uterus and by analyzing the functional consequences of the loss-of-function mutation of this receptor during implantation. Collectively, the proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that a novel signaling pathway, involving 12/15-LOX-derived lipid mediators, PPARgamma, and its downstream target genes, regulates critical events during implantation."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this U54 application is to characterize, at molecular and cellular levels, the hormonal pathways that regulate embryo implantation and fertility. Failure of the fertilized embryo to implant into the endometrium is a major cause of infertility. Following its initial attachment to the uterine epithelium, the embryo invades the endometrial stroma, which then undergoes extensive differentiation and remodeling, known as decidualization. Implantation and decidualization are complex processes driven by a cascade of signaling events regulated by the steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone. The central hypothesis of this research program is that defects in these hormonal signaling pathways lead to improper uterine receptivity, decidualization and early pregnancy loss. DNA microarray-based gene expression profiling and receptor-coregulator analyses have revealed novel steroid-regulated pathways, providing important insights into the cellular mechanisms by which implantation is controlled. Combination of this new knowledge with functional analysis in gene knockout mouse models will provide a blueprint of the molecular networks that mediate the hormonal regulation of this process. Extension of these analyses to endometrial tissues obtained from normal women as well as those with endometriosis, a common gynecologic disorder associated with reduced fertility, will provide the important translational component of this research. The program is comprised of four complementary, synergistic projects: (1) Role of C/EBP beta in Uterine Decidualization and Implantation, (2) Nuclear Receptor Co-regulators in Implantation and Uterine Function, (3) Regulation of Stromal Differentiation and Implantation by the BMP2 Pathway, and (4) Endometriosis as a Clinical Model of Predecidual Dysfunction. Investigators will be aided by an Administrative Core that will oversee inter-project interactions and data sharing, and a Microscopy Core that will provide gene and protein expression analyses in cells and tissues. In summary, the results of our studies should improve understanding of the mechanisms and cellular pathways that control implantation and help identify factors that underlie infertility in women with endometriosis. They should also aid in developing new molecular diagnostic tools for screening endometrial dysfunction and enable targeted therapeutic strategies for the treatment of infertility."
"As they look about them, infants routinely observe many different physical events: forexample, they may see a parent pour juice into a cup, stack dishes on a table, or store groceries ina cupboard. Over the past 10 years, my collaborators and I have been working on developing anaccount of how infants reason about simple physical events, and how this reasoning becomesgradually more sophisticated with experience. In the Progress Report, I summarize the results of 15projects conducted during the last grant period that helped us test and extend our account. As aresult of this research, we now have a much clearer idea of how infants' physical-reasoning systemoperates: what specific information infants are likely to represent when watching a physical event,and how they are likely to use this information to interpret and predict the event's outcome. Over the past few years, we have also begun to explore how infants who do notspontaneously represent key information about an event may be induced to do so through variouscontextual manipulations. Some of these effects appear to depend on subtle interplays between thephysical-reasoning system and two other systems suggested by findings in the adult and infantvisual cognition literature: the object-tracking system and another system my collaborators and Iterm the object-representation system. This is a truly exciting era in the field of infant cognition, asdevelopments in different subfields are coming together to paint a much more detailed picture of thecomputational architecture that underlies infants' responses to objects and events. The first project in the next grant period (PROJECT 1) will continue our investigation of thephysical-reasoning system, and will attempt to shed light on striking findings from the last grantperiod having to do with event category effects and d¿calages in infants' acquisition of their physicalknowledge. The other projects (PROJECTS 2-11) will explore possible links between the physical-reasoning system and the two other systems mentioned above. In particular, these projects shouldshed light on how infants respond not only to single events, but also to sequences of eventsinvolving the same or different objects. In all, 11 projects (comprising 30 experiments) are planned that will allow us to dramaticallyexpand our understanding of infants' physical reasoning, and to establish new and productiveconnections to other subfields of infant cognition. As in the previous grant period, the projects willuse violation-of-expectation and action tasks. In addition, we are in the process of developing oneadditional methodanticipatory-looking tasksthat should provide further converging evidence forour conclusions.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: During the first year of life, infants normally acquire a great deal of knowledge about the physical world. How do they do so?

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditionally, researchers assumed that infants understand very little about the physical world. With the advent of more sensitive methods, however, investigators have come to realize that even young infants possess expectations about physical events. What is the nature of these early expectations, and how do they develop over time? These questions have been at the core of Baillargeon's research program for the past 20 years. This application seeks to test and extend two accounts recently developed by Baillargeon and her collaborators: the first focuses on how infants use their current physical knowledge to reason about physical events and predict their outcomes (reasoning account); the other account examines how infants attain new knowledge about physical events (learning account). Each account makes several testable predictions that will be investigated in the next grant period. The proposed research builds on experiments conducted in the previous grant periods, and also introduces several new research directions. The proposed experiments will make use of two different methods, the violation-of-expectation (VOE) and the object-manipulation (OM) method. In all, 18 projects are planned, organized into seven, inter-related lines of research. These lines examine: (1) the formation and use of event categories; (2) the acquisition of variables in individual event categories; (3) early competencies in infants' reasoning about events from different categories; (4) cueing infants to reason about a new variable in an event category, through exposure to an event from a different category in which this variable has already been identified; (5) effects of event category knowledge on infants' ability to detect surreptitious changes in variable information; (6) teaching infants (in or out of the laboratory) a new variable in an event category, through exposure to appropriate events from the category; and finally (7) the formation and use of abstract object categories, namely, inert and self-moving objects. The proposed research will help us better understand how infants reason and learn about physical events, and as such will give us a conceptually richer and more detailed picture of this facet of cognitive development in infancy."
"DESCRIPTION: The principal investigator proposes a model of infants' learning about the physical world in which infants are born with a specialized learning mechanism that guides their acquisition of physical knowledge. This mechanism is thought to be responsible for two processes: (1) the formation of event categories that correspond to distinct ways in which objects behave, and (2) the identification of an initial concept and later on the elaboration of variables that affect each event category. When learning about an event category, infants first form a preliminary, all-or-none concept that captures only the essence of the category. With further experience, this initial concept is progressively elaborated. Infants slowly identify variables that are relevant to the category and incorporate this additional knowledge into their reasoning, resulting in increasingly accurate predictions over time. In past research the principal investigator has pursued the nature of the learning mechanism that directs infants' formation of event categories and identification of variables. She has examined different event categories to trace and compare their respective developmental courses. She has also attempted to 'teach' infants variables they have not yet identified by presenting them with pertinent observations. She plans to continue these lines of research, as well as undertaking a new line of research to examine whether infants can demonstrate in object-manipulation tasks the same physical knowledge that has been uncovered in visual-attention tasks."
"Recent research indicates that even 3.5-month-old infants are able to represent and to reason about the existence and properties of occluded objects. The presence of sophisticated physical reasoning at such a young age suggests that infants are born prepared to learn about physical events. Experiments on infants' reasoning about occlusion, support, and collision events suggest three hypotheses about infants' approach to the task of learning about the physical world. The first is that in their initial pass at understanding a class of physical events, infants build all-or-none, core representations that capture the essence of the events but few of the details. With further experience,e these core representations are progressively elaborated. Infants slowly identify the variables that are relevant to the events' outcomes, study their effects, and incorporate this accrued knowledge into their reasoning, resulting in increasing accurate predictions over time. The second hypothesis is that, once infants have identified variables as being relevant to events, they are able to reason first qualitatively and only later quantitatively about the effects of these variables. Finally, the third hypothesis is that, although infants' approach to learning about the physical world remains the same throughout infancy, what events are understood at what ages depends on a host of developmental factors including infant's visual, motoric, and representational abilities. The research proposed in this application will build on the three hypotheses just described. Five lines of research are planned. The first will focus on the distinction between core events and variables; some experiments will investigate further infants' understanding of the variables that affect support and collision events, while others will attempt to determine whether additional events also lend themselves to descriptions in terms of core events and variables. The second line of research will seek to shed further light on the distinction between infants' qualitative and quantitative physical reasoning. The third line of research will examine how representational factors affect the age at which infants come to understand different types of physical events. The fourth line of research will begin to examine the role of causality in infants' reasoning and learning about core events and variables. Finally, the fifth line of research will begin to explore the nature of the experiences that lead infants to identify core events and variables."

"Difficulties in acquiring verb meanings have motivated the syntactic bootstrapping theory of verb learning, which appeals to children's knowledge of syntax as well as their observations of events. But how might syntactic bootstrapping work? What relationships between sentence structure and meaning might be initially accessible to children? Recent findings have led to a revised version of syntactic bootstrapping, the analogical mapping view, in which little or no explicit syntactic knowledge is required. The central tenet of this revised view is that a representation of a sentence consisting of recognizable nouns ordered in a partial structure can be interpreted by analogy to a structured conceptual representation of an event. The proposed studies explore a strong prediction of the analogical mapping view: If children can interpret sentence structures by analogy, without prior syntax learning, then structure-sensitive interpretations of verbs should be found as soon as children can represent the structure of the sentence. To test this claim, proposed studies explore children's representations of sentences, asking under what circumstances the structural requirements of analogical mapping are met. A series of studies examines the role of repetition and priming in children's representations of speech. Does repetition in conversation allow very young children to represent multiword sentences accurately? Initial studies document a basic auditory word priming effect for 2- and 3-year-olds, and compare its properties to analogous findings with adults. Subsequent experiments follow up on this in three ways: First, the priming paradigm is used to explore preschoolers' representations of sentences, testing priming for word in sentences and for prosodic and sentence structures themselves. Second, findings on auditory priming will be compared to analyses of spontaneous speech to children, assessing how readily conversations display features which facilitate children's representation of sentences. Third, findings about children's representations of speech will be integrated into verb comprehension studies. Results from priming studies will guide the tailoring of discourse contexts for novel verbs to facilitate younger children's use of structural cues, and conversely to degrade older children's use of such cues. A more informed picture of young children's representations of input speech is crucial to testing hypotheses about the early interpretation of sentences. The priming paradigm provides a powerful tool for exploring young children's representations of language. Using this tool, the proposed studies examine how the repetition of linguistic structures supports the structure sensitive interpretation of sentences."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project studies the production and perception of phonological sequences. Our guiding assumption is that the phonological processing system is constantly changing. It adapts to recent experience, while continuing to reflect the accumulated experience of a lifetime of speaking and listening. The proposed research seeks to understand the adaptability of the phonological processing system, with an emphasis on the malleability of the system's use of general phonological patterns, such as phonotactic constraints. It is well known that speech errors or 'slips of the tongue' exhibit the phonotactic regularity effect: Errors rarely create combinations of sounds that are illegal in the language being spoken. For example, an English speaker might mispronounce 'nun' as 'nung', but not 'ngung' because that violates the constraint of English that 'ng' can never begin a syllable. We created a laboratory analog to this effect and used it to demonstrate learning. Experimental subjects recited strings of syllables in which consonants were artificially restricted to particular positions in syllables; for example, /f/ always occurred as a syllable onset. As subjects experienced these syllables, their slips became strongly sensitive to the distributions of the consonants. For example, nearly every misplacement of /f/ obeyed the rule that /f/ is an onset for this experiment. These data suggest that subjects implicitly learned the sound distributions, and this learning affected their productions. We demonstrated the same effect in perception. Subjects listened to syllables with consonant-position restrictions; in a later speeded repetition task, new syllables that were consistent with the phonotactics of the experiment were repeated more rapidly than syllables that were inconsistent. The proposed research uses these techniques to investigate learning mechanisms in the phonological processing system. The studies manipulate the phonological patterns to be acquired and make direct comparisons between production and perception and between learning by adults and infants. These experiments are informed by psychological theories of learning and linguistic theories of representation, and the obtained data will be used to constrain development of computational models of implicit learning in the phonological processing system. The research will yield a new understanding of how the processing system responds to experience, which ultimately will contribute to the treatment of language disorders and to language pedagogy."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children use syntax to understand sentences and to learn verbs; this is syntactic bootstrapping. We proposed a Structure Mapping account of the origins of syntactic bootstrapping. On this account, children begin with an unlearned bias toward one-to-one mapping between nouns in sentences and participant-roles in events. Given this bias, children find the number of nouns in a sentence inherently meaningful. In the previous funding period, we tested key predictions of this account, and found strong evidence for structure-mapping. Identifying the set of nouns in sentences yields a partial representation of syntactic structure that allows toddlers to identify verbs, and to interpret novel transitive and intransitive verbs in simple sentences. The proposed research asks how syntactic bootstrapping moves beyond 'counting the nouns', scaling up to the true complexity of verbs and sentences. We focus on two data-sources: distributional learning and discourse structure. First, we propose that distributional learning creates probabilistic syntactic-semantic combinatorial knowledge about verbs. This combinatorial knowledge, also known as verb bias, permits syntactic bootstrapping, and from early in development is used online to help identify the structure and lexical content of sentences, guiding syntactic analysis. Second, we propose that a bias toward discourse continuity increases linguistic support for verb learning by allowing learners to collectevidence for arguments across nearby sentences. Verb bias guides this process, by cuing children to seek referents for missing arguments in the discourse context. To investigate these proposals we combine experiments with toddlers and preschoolers, and a computational model based on systems for automatic semantic role labeling. Experiments with children assess comprehension of familiar and invented verbs in sentences, by measuring children's visual fixations to relevant scenes or objects. Project 1 explores toddlers' encoding of syntactic-semantic combinatorial facts about verbs from listening experience. Project 2 explores toddlers' use of discourse context to guide sentence interpretation, constrained by verb bias. Project 3 asks to what extent verb bias in preschoolers changes with new distributional learning. In Project 4 we develop our computational model to investigate the same processes. Results from experiments with children constrain the features we equip the model to detect; we use the model to test the consequences of our claims for learning from corpora of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies will advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how children learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children use syntax to understand sentences and to learn verbs; this is syntactic bootstrapping. We proposed a Structure Mapping account of the origins of syntactic bootstrapping. On this account, children begin with an unlearned bias toward one-to-one mapping between nouns in sentences and participant-roles in events. Given this bias, children find the number of nouns in a sentence inherently meaningful. In the previous funding period, we tested key predictions of this account, and found strong evidence for structure-mapping. Identifying the set of nouns in sentences yields a partial representation of syntactic structure that allows toddlers to identify verbs, and to interpret novel transitive and intransitive verbs in simple sentences. The proposed research asks how syntactic bootstrapping moves beyond 'counting the nouns', scaling up to the true complexity of verbs and sentences. We focus on two data-sources: distributional learning and discourse structure. First, we propose that distributional learning creates probabilistic syntactic-semantic combinatorial knowledge about verbs. This combinatorial knowledge, also known as verb bias, permits syntactic bootstrapping, and from early in development is used online to help identify the structure and lexical content of sentences, guiding syntactic analysis. Second, we propose that a bias toward discourse continuity increases linguistic support for verb learning by allowing learners to collectevidence for arguments across nearby sentences. Verb bias guides this process, by cuing children to seek referents for missing arguments in the discourse context. To investigate these proposals we combine experiments with toddlers and preschoolers, and a computational model based on systems for automatic semantic role labeling. Experiments with children assess comprehension of familiar and invented verbs in sentences, by measuring children's visual fixations to relevant scenes or objects. Project 1 explores toddlers' encoding of syntactic-semantic combinatorial facts about verbs from listening experience.

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental task in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents, determining who does what to whom. Verb knowledge plays a central role in this task. The verb determines what constituents can appear in the sentence, and what participant roles they will convey. In learning a new verb, a child must determine what relationship among participants the verb refers to, without the set of semantic instructions provided by the verb. The syntactic bootstrapping theory proposes that children use precursors of the adult's knowledge of syntax to understand sentences and therefore to learn verbs. This view is supported by evidence that children as young as 2 assign different meanings to verbs presented in different sentence structures. The proposed research asks what syntactic cues are helpful early in acquisition, before many of the complexities of syntax acquisition have been conquered. First, we argue that children treat the number of nouns in the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate- argument structure. The number of nouns in the sentence is useful because it provides a probabilistic indicator of the verb's number of arguments. Second, early syntactic bootstrapping requires that children represent language experience in an abstract mental vocabulary that permits rapid generalization of syntactic learning to new verbs. Thus, we argue that language-specific grammatical learning, such as detecting the significance of word order in English, should transfer quickly to sentences containing new verbs, permitting progressively finer constraint on sentence interpretation and verb learning. This project explores how syntactic bootstrapping begins, and how it interacts with early progress in syntax acquisition. We take two complementary approaches: (1) Experiments with infants and toddlers will investigate the detection and use of the proposed simple structural cues to sentence interpretation and verb learning. (2) Computational experiments using a system for automatic semantic role labeling will test the main claims of our account using a substantial sample of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies is intended to advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and to guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how infants and toddlers learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy."
"DESCRIPTION: Specific tissue interactions, or 'inductive interactions,' control the development of all vertebrate organ systems. The first example of this was demonstrated in the context of vertebrate lens development, over 100 years ago. Subsequently, the eye/lens has served as a model system for understanding the general nature of inductive interactions, due to its accessibility to direct experimental manipulation, particularly in amphibian embryos. Although a great deal is known about tissue interactions involved in lens induction, we have just begun to decipher molecular events that control lens cell determination and differentiation. The goal of this study is to identify genes involved in controlling these processes. In some organisms, lenses can regenerate via the transdifferentiation of other differentiated larval or adult cell types. In Xenopus, the cornea epithelium can undergo transdifferentiation to form a new lens when the original lens is removed. We have exploited this process as a convenient one to isolate genes involved in lens formation. A large suite of genes were recovered from a subtracted cDNA library, enriched for those expressed during the process of cornea-lens transdifferentiation. Preliminary studies indicate that many of these genes are also expressed during embryonic lens development. A high-throughput approach employing robotic in situ hybridization will be applied to characterize the expression of these genes during lens development and regeneration. This data will provide an understanding of the molecular relationships between these two lens-forming processes. A number of transcriptional regulators and cell signaling factors are represented amongst those genes, which are likely to play key roles in controlling the processes of lens development and regeneration. We will examine the functions of these genes using specific assays, including: in vivo loss-of-function and gain-of- function analyses. These functional studies will be performed in conjunction with expression analyses to decipher molecular pathways of lens formation. Finally, gene expression and function will be examined in the context of the current model of lens induction, via tissue transplantation and explant culture experiments. An understanding of molecular and cellular relationships between lens development and regeneration, and the genes controlling lens cell determination and differentiation, will ultimately lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat injured and diseased lenses."
"Embryogeneis is a complex process whereby the fertilized egg gives rise to a multicellular adult organism. In vertebrate embryos, inductive interactions between specific tissues play a major role in determining cell fate. The vertebrate lens provides an appropriate model system to define the molecular mechanism involved in determining cell fate because development is triggered by a series of specific tissue interactions. Lens differentiation involves several stages: competence, specification and determination. Xenopus laevis represents a convenient, manipulatable system in which to study lens development because these stages have been temporally defined, as have the specific tissue interactions that are required. In Xenopus, the larval cornea can undergo transdifferentiation into lens. This process arguably reflects the natural events in lens determination and differentiation. This represents a convenient system from which to isolate genes involved in transdifferentiation and, theoretically in the various stages of embryonic lens formation. The PI has created a subtracted cDNA library enriched for genes that are specific to transdifferentiation. The library will be screened for genes potentially involved in transdifferentiation and lens induction and candidates assessed for their roles in these processes by expression studies and functional tests. The expression patterns of a number of these genes will be used to test models of lens induction in tissue transplantation experiments. Finally, experiments will be performed to identify growth factors that elicit lens formation in cultures of cornea and embryonic ectoderm tissue. Both factors suspected to play a role based on existing evidence and newly identified factors isolated from a retinal cDNA library will be tested."
"DESCRIPTION: Embryogenesis represents a complex process whereby a single cell, the fertilized egg, gives rise to the multicellular, adult organism. In vertebrate embryos specific tissue interactions, termed inductive interactions, play a major role in determining various cell fates. The general goal of this research is to understand the molecular and cellular basis of these processes. Vertebrate lens development has served as a model system in which to examine these events, since the development of this organ is triggered by a series of specific tissue interactions. The success of this system is due to its accessibility to direct experimental manipulation, particularly in amphibian embryos. While the PI has a firm understanding of the tissue interactions involved in vertebrate lens inductions, very little is known about the molecular basis for the process of lens cell determinination, or the signaling molecules involved in lens induction. These issues are the main focus of this research proposal. Continued effort will be devoted to identifying specific changes in gene expression which are associated with the processes of lens cell determination and differentiation using the from Xenopus laevis. In Xenopus, the larval cornea can undergo transdifferentiation to form a lens. Substantial evidence indicates that this process is related to that of embryonic lens development at both the molecular and cellular levels. The phenomenon of cornea-lens transdifferentiation represents a more convenient system with which to isolate genes involved in the processes of lens cell determination and differentiation. A subtracted cDNA library, enriched in clones representing gene activity associated with the process of cornea-lens transdifferentition, will be screened. As genes are isolated, their expression will be studied during the process of embryonic lens formation, and specific tests will be conducted to determine the role they play in this process. The expression patterns of these genes, along with those the PI has already obtained, will be used as markers in tissue transplantation and tissue culture experiments to examine the role that specific tissue interactions play in triggering changes in gene expression during embryonic lens induction. Finally, experiments will be performed to determine whether specific growth factors elicit lens formation in cultures of cornea and embryonic ectodermal tissues. There is mounting evidence that growth factors play important roles in embryonic cell determination."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cornea, our 'window to the world,' is subject to damage caused by injury, infection and other diseases. Approaches are being developed to treat these corneas by transplantation of cornea epithelial stem cells. A major medical challenge lies in being able to isolate sufficient quantities of these cells for culture, expansion, and transplantation. We still lack a basic understanding of their proliferation, migratory behaviors and precise markers to identify these cells. We also do not know what factors regulate these behaviors, which is essential for enhancing the therapeutic potential of cornea epithelial stem cells. Recent evidence suggests that cutaneous nerves may be a key component of the epithelial stem cell niche. The frog Xenopus is an established vertebrate model with distinct advantages for studies of cell and molecular biology. The development and morphology of the mature frog cornea is essentially identical to that of humans. We developed tools that make Xenopus an excellent system to study the biology of these cells. Our central hypotheses are that limbal stem cells and their proliferative progeny exhibit specific cleavage patterns and express specific combinations of genes that will allow one to distinguish these cells. Further, these cells respond to cues released by damage to undergo increased proliferation, being able to migrate to wound sites, and finally that nerves serving the cornea represent a critical component of the epithelial stem cell niche that regulates the behavior of these cells. This proposal has three specific aims to address these hypotheses: I) determine the normal proliferative patterns and gene expression profiles to distinguish these stem cells and their progeny, and examine the role of pluripotency genes in regulating the behavior of these cells. II) Determine how these cells respond to damage and whether they undergo active migration during homeostasis and repair. III). Determine if cutaneous nerves of the cornea play a key role in supporting these proliferative cells. To address these aims we developed new tools that permit direct, continuous visualization of these cells in live animals over prolonged periods of time. We have also developed Xenopus models to study cornea wound repair and limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). Finally, we can ligate the corneal nerves with tremendous precision to test their role in supporting these cells. This research is innovative in its use of high-throughpu transgenic approaches in Xenopus to permit real-time observations of live cornea epithelial stem cells in which we can characterize specific patterns of gene expression (markers) that identify these cells. This study will also determine if corneal nerves represent a critical component of the stem cell niche that supports these cells. Tens of thousands of patients develop neurotrophic keratitis, forms of corneal dystrophy, LSCD, and other eye conditions annually in the U.S. that require corneal transplants (about 40,000/year). The proposed research is significant, as it will develop tools and approaches that can be used to treat these diseases and injuries of the cornea."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to establish and maintain close friendships is central to physical and mental health throughout the life course. The quality of the early child-mother attachment relationship is one factor that may forecast friendship competence during the preschool and school years. Little is known, however, about the interpersonal mechanisms through which children's attachment and friend relationships are related. This study aims to assess maternal mental-state talk as a potential mediator of attachment-friend linkages. Through talk about mental states, mothers may foster children's psychological understanding of behavior, which, in turn, has implications for effectively managing interpersonal interactions. Notably, child-mother attachment security and child-friend interactions have each been associated with mental-state talk, yet no single study has brought together these two lines of research. Thus, the specific aims of the proposed study are to examine: (a) maternal mental-state talk at 24 months as a function of infant-mother attachment at 15 months, (b) maternal mental-state talk at 24 months as a predictor of children's friendship competence at 36 months, 54 months, kindergarten, and first grade, and (c) maternal mental-state talk as a mediator of longitudinal attachmentfriend associations. In addressing these aims, data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care (SECC) will be utilized. Given the relatively large sample, as well as the multiple and varied assessments of mother-child and child-friend relationships, the NICHD SECC provides a unique opportunity in which to test the proposed mediational model. Videotaped mother-child play sessions at 24 months will be transcribed and coded for maternal mental-state talk. Structural equation modeling will be conducted to assess the validity of the mediational model. Multigroup analyses will assess whether child gender moderates the proposed associations. In addition, several competing models will be tested. By illuminating the interpersonal processes through which children's early attachment relationships are related to their subsequent relationships with friends, researchers and clinicians will be better equipped to design and implement preventive interventions for children at risk for relationship disturbances."

"PROJECT SUMMARYAnimal and human studies indicate that extreme forms of early life stress are implicated in structural andfunctional maladaptation in the brain during the early life course. At the same time, research ondevelopmental psychopathology has indicated that early caregiving and development of insecure ordisorganized attachment put children at risk for maladaptive behavioral and emotional problems. Thus, theroots of psychopathology likely take shape during this period of development in the context of transactionsbetween the infant, caregiving environment, and developing brain architecture. Yet, we know little about thepotential neurobiological mechanisms linking these transactional processes. Leveraging new methods forassessing infant brain via resting state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), this exploratory/developmental project aims to explore how integration of neural networks over the first year of life vary as afunction of caregiving processes and underlie differences in attachment security/insecurity at the end of thefirst year. In doing so, we will use longitudinal assessments and multimethod techniques to examine howthe quality of infant-mother attachment contributes to intra-network and inter-network connectivity from 3 to12 months using dynamic whole-brain data-driven approaches. At 3 and 12 months of age, infant scans willbe conducted during natural sleep, and resting state functional MRI and DTI will assess changes infunctional and structural large-scale network connectivity. At 3, 6, and 9 months, infant-mother interactionswill be assessed via (a) an established paradigm that provides age-appropriate assessment of infantattachment-related behavior, and (b) new technology that enables collection of the infant's naturalistic homeenvironment on a large-scale using an automated system that is reliable and valid. At 12 months, infant-mother attachment will be assessed via the gold-standard Strange Situation Procedure. By incorporatingmultiple levels of analysis across multiple time scales, our project will provide novel insight into transactionsamong maternal caregiving, infant behavior, and neural networks across the first year of life that underlieinfants' attachment-related behavior and representations. Such innovation holds promise for conceptualadvances in understanding the role of early caregiving environments in the development of early trajectoriesof brain and behavior, as well as potential applications for preventive intervention."
"EXCEED THE SPACE PROVIDED. The purpose of this established and growing interdisciplinary program is to train postdoctoral and predoctoral fellows in the molecular biology, endocrinology, molecular genetics, and integrative physiology of reproduction. There are 17 postdoctoral and 51 predoctoral trainees, and they have background experience in one or more biological disciplines, such as endocrinology, reproductive biology, neurobiology and molecular biology. Fifteen faculty members, who areappointed in four discipline-related departments - Animal Sciences, Biochemistry, Molecular andIntegrative Physiology, and Veterinary Biosciences (some faculty are cross-appointed in Cell and Structural Biology) - provide great breadth and depth in research training opportunities. Current projects on all classes of reproductive hormones cover many aspects of both male and female reproductive biology. Studies are conducted on both small and large animals at the molecular, cellular, organ, and whole animal levels. Ongoing research projects relate directly to major national health-related objectives, such as regulating male and female fertility, arresting the growth of hormone- dependent mammary and prostate cancer, providing postmenopausal protection from bone demineralization, understanding the causes of and securing treatment for endometriosis and uterine fibroids, preventing prolonged and difficult delivery, and characterizing substances within the environment that disrupt the reproductive system. Postdoctoral trainees are involved principally in independent original research, and they generally complete their training in 3-4 years. Predoctoral trainees take courses in endocrinology and physiology of reproduction as well as related topics, such as biochemistry, molecular biology, immunology, and statistics before beginning independent research. The majority of the 4-5 years that are generally required to complete predoctoral training is spent conducting independent research. Trainees and staff participate in a weekly research conference to discuss research proposals and progress. They also gain a solid understanding of research areas beyond that in which they are engaged by participating weekly in an advanced endocrinology seminar. In this seminar, students and staff present critical reviews and current advances in a specific research area throughout a 15-week period. Twice each year faculty and trainees participate in instruction in the responsible conduct of research. Trainees attend and present papers at national scientific meetings. Scientists from other institutions visit our laboratories to consult with students and faculty and to present seminars. Faculty laboratories are capable of supporting a diverse training program because they are large, modern and well equipped. They are equipped for research that involves a variety of molecular biology techniques as well as procedures in protein isolation and characterization, histology, autoradiography, tissue culture, and hormone assays. The University also provides the following modern research facilities that support biomedical research: Animal Care Units (housing and surgery facilities for small and large animals), Immunological Resource Center, Protein Sciences Facility (sequence determination, peptide synthesis and mass spectrometry), Flow Cytometry Facility, W. M. Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics (microarray technologies, DNA sequencing, oligonucleotide synthesis, functional genomics, high throughput sequencing, and bioinformatics), Beckman Imaging Technology Group and the Center for Microscopic Imaging. Financial support is sought for three postdoctoral and five predoctoral trainees. PERFORMANCE SITE ========================================Section End==========================================="
"Our long-range objective is to develop a clearer fundamental understanding of the molecular basis of fertilization so that the process can be controlled to either promote fertilization or block it. Much progress has been made to identify ZP3, the protein in the mammalian egg coat that binds sperm and stimulates the acrosome reaction, the release of the acrosomal vesicle that must occur for sperm to penetrate the egg coat. Despite this progress, the identity of the ZP3 receptor on sperm has been elusive. One strong candidate is beta1,4-galactosyltransferase, an enzyme first discovered in the Golgi apparatus of somatic cells but later found on the surface of sperm. Beta1,4-Galactosyltransferase binds ZP3 but not other egg coat proteins. In addition to its role in gamete adhesion, beta1,4- galactosyltransferase acts to trigger the acrosome reaction in sperm. The acrosome reaction can be stimulated with antibodies to beta1,4-galactosyltransferase that act as mimics of ZP3 to bind and crosslink beta1,4-galactosyltransferase. There is evidence that binding beta1,4-galactosyltransferase stimulates at least some of the same signaling systems inside sperm that ZP3 stimulates, leading to the proposal that beta1,4- galactosyltransferase may be the major ZP3 receptor signaling the acrosome reaction. Mice with a targeted deletion of the beta1,4-galactosyltransferase gene, although fertile, produce sperm with severely compromised ability to acrosome react and penetrate the egg coat. In this proposal, the signaling systems that are activated by beta1,4-galactosyltransferase will be studied. The goals are to determine if binding beta1,4-galactosyltransferase specifically can completely reproduce all of the identified signaling systems activated by ZP3 binding, to study beta1,4-galactosyltransferase mutants to identify structural features necessary for signaling, and to identify proteins that interact with the portion of beta1,4- galactosyltransferase found in the cytosol. These studies will clarify the role of a sperm receptor for the egg coat in the acrosome reaction, a necessary step in the process of fertilization."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The invasion of a host germline by infectious retroviruses has been a common evolutionary event that shaped the genomes of all vertebrates, including humans. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) comprise ca. 8% of the human genome, where they play a role in placentation and in a number of diseases. Despite their ubiquity, until recently all identified ERVs had entered their host germline thousands or millions of years ago. Many ERVs have undergone mutations, deletions and recombination, and many retroviruses that gave rise to ERVs may be extinct. Thus, the evolutionary events that occurred as retroviruses invaded host genomes can be difficult to infer. Recently, an emerging koala retrovirus (KoRV), linked to a high incidence of leukemia and immune system suppression in Australian koalas, was discovered to be in the midst of transitioning from being an infectious exogenous virus to becoming an endogenous part of the koala genome. To date, KoRV is the only known exogenous retrovirus that is currently in the midst of invading a host germ line. Our objective is to use KoRV to understand the process by which an infectious retrovirus invades its host germline, a process that has shaped the human genome, as it actually happens. We will determine how the genetic diversity of KoRV is evolving across loci, individuals, and populations. Museum samples of koalas will be used to determine how the genetic diversity of KoRV has evolved over time. Differences between ancient and modern KoRV will be determined, and examined for their effects on functional properties of the virus. The specific aims are: (1) Examine the sequence diversity and insertional polymorphisms of KoRV across the geographic range of the host population, from which the origins, spread and evolution of KoRV may be inferred. (2) Use archival samples of koalas to directly determine the evolution of genetic and functional diversity of KoRV across the time period during which KoRV emerged in a new host and invaded the germline. (3) Use complete proviral genomes and known host pedigrees to examine the evolutionary events that are shaping KoRV. The complete genomes of individual KoRVs will be sequenced and analyzed to determine the degree to which KoRVs invading their host germ line are being affected by selection, recombination, open reading frame disruptions, host anti-viral mechanisms, and host population structure."

The complete genomes of individual KoRVs will be sequenced and analyzed to determine the degree to which KoRVs invading their host germ line are being affected by selection, recombination, open reading frame disruptions, host anti-viral mechanisms, and host population structure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Retrovirus-like elements that comprise 8% of the human genome play a role in health and disease, yet the process by which endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) invaded and shaped the genomes of humans is difficult to study since human ERVs are millions of years old. There is only one known infectious retrovirus currently in the midst of invading the germ line of its host, a koala retrovirus (KoRV) linked to leukemias and immune suppression. Understanding the evolutionary events affecting the genetic diversity of KoRV, and how KoRV changed as it invaded the host germ line provides an opportunity for research into how ERVs evolve and affect the genomes of all vertebrates, including humans."
"Despite recent widespread recognition of child depression as a valid and potentially debilitating clinical phenomenon, controversy remains as to the etiology, significance, and prognostic power of depression in childhood. The primary goal of the proposed research is to identify the antecedents and sequelae of depression during the early course of disorder. A particular focus is placed on understanding the rise in depression during adolescence, especially in girls. The model guiding the research posits that family dysfunction in the form of parental depression and lifetime family disruptions fosters the development of maladaptive conceptions of interpersonal relationships and ineffective coping, which create a vulnerability to depression. Stressful circumstances, including the negotiation of normative developmental transitions, are hypothesized to activate this vulnerability, leading to depression during transition periods. Girls are expected to be most sensitive to these processes due to personal characteristics as well as the experience of unique challenges during adolescence. Finally, depression is expected to induce further psychosocial disruption, which increases the likelihood of persistence or recurrence of disorder across adolescence. This proposed multivariate model will be examined using a prospective, multi-informant, multi-method design. Subgroups of depressed, externalizing, and comparison children selected from a community sample will be followed over a period of 2 1/2 years to explore the social-cognitive, affective, interpersonal, and contextual processes underlying onset and recurrence of depression during the early course of disorder. Ultimately, it is anticipated that knowledge from such research can inform the creation of empirically based intervention programs designed to treat childhood-onset depression."
"Over the past 2 decades, victimization among school children has become a growing public health concern. Once believed to be a normative and even acceptable part of growing up, this myth has now been dispelled. Consequently, researchers have become interested in understanding why some children are more likely to be victimized, and how this victimization affects their well being. The goal of the proposed research is to identify the psychological, emotional, behavioral, and physiological antecedents and consequences of victimization. A transactional model is proposed to explain how victimization in the peer group influences a range of developmental processes, which then place children at further risk. Specifically, this model posits that exposure to peer victimization contributes to maladaptive social-cognitive processes, ineffective emotional and behavioral self-regulatory responses, global emotional and behavioral dysfunction, and heightened adrenocortical reactivity. These developmental consequences, in turn, are proposed to heighten children's sensitivity to future interpersonal stress, as well as to cause children to generate additional stress in their relationships, including further victimization. Personal attributes of children and characteristics of victimization experiences are expected to influence how children react to victimization. This model will be evaluated in the context of a prospective longitudinal study. 400-second graders will be followed across four years using child, parent, and teacher reports. A sub-sample of children will participate in two observational procedures. First, observations will be conducted of natural playground interactions each of the four years to examine children's experiences with familiar peers, including incidents of victimization, and how they respond to stressful situations. Second, observations will be conducted using a laboratory paradigm to examine victimized children's responses to a social challenge during an interaction with an unfamiliar peer. Evaluation of the proposed transactional model will advance efforts to understand how children and their environments jointly contribute to development, and will provide a broad conceptual framework for understanding long-term risk in victimized children over time and across social groups. Moreover, this research will provide a basis for the creation of child-level and school-level programs designed to interrupt the cycle of victimization, violence, and distress associated with maltreatment by peers."
"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peer victimization is a salient form of early adversity with long-term costs for youths' mental health. Indeed, research and media coverage place peer victimization on the national agenda as a critical public health issue, given its prevalence and it implications for emotional well-being into adolescence and adulthood. Identifying processes accounting for these enduring effects is critical for informing policy and practice, yet scientistshave not yet discovered the processes through which victimization derails youths' development-that is, how victimization 'gets under the skin' in ways that instill long-term risk. Inspired by a growing recognition of the pervasive impact of early life stress on maturing brain systems and associated psychopathology, this research will contribute substantially to scientific knowledge and its application by documenting the adolescent sequelae of victimization, with broader implications for enriching our understanding of the mechanisms through which early adversity shapes stress reactivity and mental health. Integrating ideas across the fields of developmental and social psychology, social affective neuroscience, and developmental psychopathology with the NIMH RDoC framework, this research will examine whether victimization is linked to dysregulated negative valence systems involved in sustained threat/loss, thereby heightening reactivity and compromising regulation and contributing to adolescent depression. Introducing an innovative methodological approach into the field of peer victimization, this research will use a multi-level design, examining reactivity and regulation at both the neural and behavioral levels in the context of an experimental design (laboratory cues of social threat/loss). This study will take advantage of an existing sample of adolescent girls (10th-11th graders), well-characterized on victimization, individual differences in risks and resources, and mental health from 2nd-9th grade, thereby providing the opportunity to leverage a comprehensive longitudinal data set to enrich the proposed short-term (two-year) investigation of neural/behavioral processing and depressive symptoms. Thus, this study is uniquely positioned to examine the link between childhood victimization and subsequent neural and behavioral processing of social cues as well as to determine whether stress reactivity/regulation account for the contribution of victimization to adolescent depression. This research also will provide novel data on individual differences in risk and resilience processes, thereby maximizing the efficiency of prevention/intervention programs. Ultimately, it is anticipated that this researc will serve as a basis for larger longitudinal studies investigating: (a) how early adversity withina variety of contexts influences emerging brain systems in ways that set the stage for adolescent mental health problems; and (b) individual and contextual resources that may buffer youth against these adverse consequences. This line of research can yield clear and compelling implications for policy and practice guidelines aimed at minimizing the threat posed by early social adversity to youths' health and development, with potential implications for long-term adaptation and societal burden."

"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to explore the potential health benefits of Guo Lin Qi-gong, a Chinese body-mind exercise, in long-term cancer survival. There are three specific aims in this study: 1. Determine the long-term impact of Guo Lin Qi-gong on quality of life (QOL) and other health outcomes; 2. Determine energy expenditure (EE) characteristics of Guo Lin Qi-gong; 3. Explore the optimal practice of Guo Lin Qi-gong with a focus on frequency, duration and application of different components in different stages of cancer survival. A cross-sectional group-comparison study design will be employed to address these aims, in which a group of long-term (>10 yr.) cancer survivors (n = 40, 20 per gender), who practiced Guo Lin Qi-gong during their survival period, will be recruited from Shanghai, China. Their QOL, body composition, physical activity participation, psychological wellbeing and other related health status will be compared with a matching control sample (also n = 40, 20 per gender; matching variables = age, gender, type of cancer, stage of the cancer at diagnosis, and survival years). In addition, their EE during Guo Lin Qi-gong practices, as well as during a 6-min free-living walk, will be collected and investigated; and finally, their Guo Lin Qi-gong practice and experienced benefits will be examined along with any challenges they may have had. It is expected that, based on the information collected from this study, a more appropriate Guo Lin Qi-gong clinical trial study can be designed and the effectiveness of Guo Lin Qi-gong can be determined empirically. These efforts will establish a strong, evidence-based foundation for the future introduction and promotion of Guo Lin Qi-gong to US cancer survivors."
"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for obesity, diabetes and individuals' general health. Recently, there is a growing interest in using walking, the oldest and most basic physical activity (PA), to promote PA. Walking has proven to be both a healthful and popular mode of PA because it can be done almost anywhere and requires no special equipment (Lumsdon & Mitchell, 1999; Rafferty et al., 2002). However, according to a recent population survey (Eyler et al., 2003), only 34 percent of respondents were regular walkers (five times 30 minutes walking per week), 45.6 percent were occasional walkers (walked, but did not meet the PA recommendation) and 20.7 percent were never walkers. Similarly, children's daily walking has been significantly decreasing during the past several decades. Further, we only have limited knowledge on people's walking behaviors and related correlates. Many critical walking research questions need addressing, e.g., How many steps should a person walk a day? What is the best way to measure people's walking behavior? What is the impact of environmental changes on people's walking behavior? To address these issues, we are organizing a 'Walking for Health' conference focused on measurement and research issues. The conference will provide a forum to update and address critical measurement and research issues, as well as practical concerns, in walking and health research and practice. The conference is an extension and continuation of our 2003 measurement and aging conference, which was a great success. Key information of the conference is summarized below: Title: Walking for Health: Measurement and Research Issues and Challenges Date: October 13-15, 2005 Location: University of Illinois, Urbana, IL Type of participants: PA and health researchers and practitioners. N = 250 are expected. Specific aims: 1. To provide updated and multidisciplinary views on walking and health research and practice; 2. To address critical measurement and research challenges in walking and health research and explore of potentials the latest technology and methods for the challenges; 3. To exchange the latest research progress in walking and health research; 4. To provide a training on measurement and statistical methods and programming skills. Topics covered: Very broad topics will be covered in three pre-conference sessions, two keynotes, 12 conference sections and discussions, and two poster sessions."
