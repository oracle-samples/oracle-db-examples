Because of this, it feels as if there is no support/stability.My partial orthotic fit well into the heel of the shoe.The shoe not only has aqua-colored accents (shoe string eyelets) but also has an aqua liner throughout the shoe. As I was slipping my socked foot into the shoe for the first time, that inner liner sort of bunched up and made the shoe top look distorted.

Good quality components.  However, as other reviewers have said, the insole makes wearing these shoes impossible.  The surface of the insoles is some attractive suede fabric which looks like it will be very comfortable.  In fact, the fabric prevents your foot from sliding into the shoe.  I forced my feet in and my toes were uncomfortably turned in on them selves, I could not possibly wear these shoes like that.  I tried stockings and different types of socks with the same difficulty, I just could not push my foot smoothly into the shoe.  Then I tried taking the insole out of another pair of sneakers and putting them in the Aragon’s.  My foot slid right in but when I walked there was no arch support.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001MBLNU2,Dan Post Men's Albuquerque Black Size: 9.5 X-Wide,Lucas A Vaughn,Quality design has been exchanged for quick profit. Sorry I gotta move on to a new brand.,"I've been buying dan post albuquerque boots for several years now and they have been great until now. They have obviously changed the manufacturing to a much lower quality. I usually plan on buying a pair every year. I use my boots pretty hard in the garage for welding and fabricating and so far the albuquerque has taken the beating gracefully. But as soon as I opened the box for the new pair I immediately noticed the difference in quality. I included pictures of the old boot compared with the new one. The heal used to have layers of leather between the layers of sole material (rubber, plastic, poly-blablabla whatever?) It was tacked in to place and provided a sturdy support. The new boot has a chunk of foam like garbage the same as any pair of cheap garbage boot one could buy at Walmart. But they compensate for it by coloring it to look like layers of leather. I did try them on and they just didn't feel the same. The sturdy support I have come to count on has been replaced by a feeling of cheap low quality design compromises in exchange for quick profit. With a history of plantar fasciitus I just can't take the chance of wearing low quality footwear.

I have been a Wellington and Cowboy type Boot guy for Decades and had to stop wearing because of the high Heel causing lower Back Pain and thought I’d try the Dan Post due to the Reviews. I’ve always been a Justin Boot Guy with my first Justin Boots in 1987 but just sent back a pair after wearing them for 5 hours due to Pain and stitches popping on the  Left Boot, Justin has Issues now for some reason. I received my Dan Post today immediately put them on and WOW they are the most comfortable Cowboy Boot I’ve ever put on my Feet, I went to Walmart and walked for 2 hours and zero Back Pain from a non broken in Cowboy Boot, that’s unheard of and if you’re a Boot Person you know what I’m talking about, some discomfort is expected with new Boots. I have a flat kind of wide Foot and wear a 13 tennis shoe and I ordered the 12 EW because they were a lot cheaper and they fit just fine and in fact I could have worn an 11 1/2 and maybe had my Cobbler stretch them if needed. I’m so happy I snagged these Dan Post Boots and I’m just amazed at the Comfort Level from this type of Boot, I can’t imagine how Insanely Comfortable the Blayde or the Storm Tide would be with the extra cushion.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001MBLNU2,Dan Post Men's Albuquerque Black Size: 9.5 X-Wide,Bj S.,super nice but heel fits weird,"These are comfortable and cushy in the foot. The toe box is narrow at first but you can use a cedar shoe tree to make room in the toes, to open the toe area for a better fit.  I wear a women's 8.5 and the men's size 7 fit well w/ an added 3/4 insert to fill up the space in the heels and add support. These would be great for winter, with the sturdy rubber soles with tread, and warm lining. But the heels were placed at an odd angle on these, so that I kept rocking back on the heels.  I put them on a table and saw the heels do not sit flush on a flat surface. This caused the front part of the heel to dig into the bottom of my foot when wearing, and I was constantly rocking back on the heels.I think this was a defect, so returned them. I read reviews that they now make these with a cheaper 'brushed or suede' type leather,  in the past they were made with a smooth leather, so the boots are no longer an ""oily brown"" as described, but more a reddish brown suede.  I noticed the boots suede leather wrinkled quickly just in trying them on, and I was not nuts about that. One way to fix that is to apply mink oil or red wing leather cream, and this smooths out the nap so they have a smooth leather finish and not suede. Boot manufacturers are swapping out this 'nappy brushed leather or suede' for real smooth leather on many boots, b/c it must be cheaper. Sad b/c the smooth leather looks better and wears longer.",4.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 19 September 2021,,95aa85b1-7a17-53aa-b913-3a44d53f3d22,24/12/2021 02:26:30
https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001MBLNU2,Dan Post Men's Albuquerque Black Size: 9.5 X-Wide,J,Update: Comfy if you can get them on.,I read a review before buying these where the guy noted that he had difficulty getting his heal down into the boot and as a result the fabric at he bottom of the shaft and the top of the heal cup tore.  Dan Post apparently fixed that problem buy adding a leather reenforcement. When I first put them on the left one went on fine but with the right one I had a good deal of difficulty getting my heal past the leather patch and into the heal cup.  It has gotten progressively worse until now I can not get the right one on no matter how hard I try.  Perhaps a boot horn would help but...anyway great boots if you can get them on. Very comfortable.  Not sure what to do at this point...So I contacted amazon and I am returning the original pair.  They sent out a new pair. This is an entirely different boot.  They are at least 1/2 too small.  MUCH narrower especially when viewed form the bottom. The sole is 1/2 narrower.  The Dan Post Tag is a different color (green and yellow as opposed to the black and gold of the original).  The heal seems higher.  Leather is inferior. Weird.  I called Dan Post and they said they are always making design changes.  Looks like I'm just going to get my money back.

From mud to motorcycles in the snow and rain, these boots have done all I've asked and more.  In fact they're still going and I can't stand not wear them because they're incredibly comfortable and just get better looking the more beat up they get.  I like them so much that I just bought a new pair to replace them only because the side seams and piping are starting to blow out and the sole of the heal is ready to hit leather.  I would have them resoled if it were not for the seam coming apart.I've given them 4 stars only because of the seam and piping but the fact that I bought another identical pair tells you that 4 stars is a great rating for me.The only time I don't wear these boots is when I'm working-out or I'm hiking.  Otherwise I wear them everywhere from business travel to working in the field.Pros:The fit is dead on at 9DComfort is excellentWaterproofing is excellentDurability is excellentLooks are excellentCon: The plastic piping and seams come apart before the rest of the boot is worn out.

Like it doesn't have hard plate in mid sole which keeps ur midfoot stable or say solid heel lock is missing. No extra layers of protection, in terms of cushioning in the sole. Laces are just basic. Build quality is ok but not great. Not suitable for broad feet. Decent but I think Asics Gel Nimbus and Mizuno Waverider are miles ahead of it in terms of neutral road running shoe.

It’s tight mid-foot because of some band on the top but it’s actually loose in the toe box. When shoes fit this bad, I just can not recommend them for anything.

What is extremely disappointing is the cushioning level.  What you see on the side of the shoe is not at all what is actually in the sole cushion.  I was looking forward to the Boost cushioning.  Instead, what you get appears to be less than a 1/4 inch of cushioning.  After playing a few games on a hard court, my knees were extremely sore.  All the cushioning you see around the heel is window dressing.

There is comfortable padding on the ankle, so no worry abt clipping a rock and having it knock your bone. Also the weight of these boots is incredible. SO LIGHT!!!

Maybe avoid in general!!!,"Don’t waste your time with these.  So I bought the boots in October of 2019.  Yes they are very comfortable and light, but my boots tore right  where the black part of the bottom seams to the shoe. It’s the area where the foot would flex as you step.  I contacted Vasque Red Wing and they told me they offer a 12 month warranty on any manufacturer defects. Sounds great! They told me they have a defect contract with Amazon to take care of this.  So I then reach out to amazon and they tell me that I’m past my 30 days and that they would pro rate me part of the refund and I would keep the boots and get them fixed myself. Sounds great, but that didn’t happen either, they send me a return label and will refund me 80% of the boot value because it’s considered a late return.  Failure from both companies. The 12 month warranty means nothing from Vasque and Amazon did nothing to help. My suggestion is to buy directly from a retailer. Then you may have a chance with the boot warranty.  It’s a tough pill to swallow for 4 month old boots that are $100+.Update:1/30/2020-  apparently Vasque is having issues with Amazon honoring their 12month defect contract.  Once I got this through for Vasque to understand, they offered me a replacement pair of boots, making good with their warranty.

Light weight and versatile,"I am a full time vegetable farmer and my shoes have to go through some serious work throughout the season! For the past three months I’ve had these boots and I’ve really loved them. They’ve got a nice tread that I’m kept quite stable walking on rough terrain all day, but they don’t cake quite so heavily with mud when I am working in wet soil.Like any boot that isn’t a rubber rain boot, they will get moist in the inside if I’m really soaking them in puddles and such, but on wet mornings they stay quite dry when I’m walking through dewy grass. I still usually wear Muck boots in those conditions though.The best thing about these boots is their weight and flexibility. My feet and legs really enjoy the sneaker-like feel to these and I can wear them all day and not feel like I’ve got lead weights on my feet. Additionally, they’ve been super easy to hose off at the end of the day.Finally, I’ve been working in 90+ degree days in these and when I’m wearing my summer weight socks, I’m not get boiling hot feet. So that’s a huge plus.Just remember to size up! I was worried that even when I sized up they were a little snug around the edges of my feet (my feet are a relatively normal width, maybe a tiny bit wide), but after even a day of wearing them, they stretched out some and are my favorite farming boot to date!For reference, I typically am walking 3-5 miles a day on the farm and doing lots of bending and crouching. I have yet to see indications of wear at the crease points near the base of my toes from crouching, which is always the first place to “go” in my work boots.So far, they’ve been worth the investment!

I've been hiking for years, and I know from experience this design flaw puts you at higher risk for a sprained or broken ankle.  The tread on the sole around the back outside of the shoe does not extend to the edge, which means, when you lean your anke to the side, there is a point at which the shoe will buckle for lack of support, and you're going down!

At first I found them to be too small, that is until I realized they just fit closer to my foot’s natural shape than normal shoes do.  If you’re used to the way American work boots fit (extremely large) you may find these “too small”.  They have a deep heal cup, pretty high arch support, and a slightly more square toe box than normal shoes.  The soles have fantastic grip on rocks, and are pretty much the best combination of cushion without being too vague or soft that I have found in a shoe.  I also like that the sole isn’t overly wedged forward like a running shoe, it gives these boots a really planted feeling in rough terrain.  In fact, after wearing these boots for a couple consecutive long off-trail hikes and then switching to a more normal running shoe, I found it surprisingly difficult to keep my footing in the running shoes, which made me realize how great these boots are at keeping my feet stable.  The lacing system is pretty normal, nothing funky, but I will say that the all black and two military looking colors seem to be the only 3 versions with captive upper eyelets instead of hooks - in my opinion the hooks can be dangerous if not lethal by accidentally snagging the laces from the opposite shoe (giving a momentary “feet tied together type fall)...this is especially dangerous if you plan to be climbing around rocks or in areas where a fall could be disastrous/deadly.I like these boots so much I’m buying a second pair incase they’re discontinued.",5.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 16 February 2021,2 people found this helpful,eea478fa-e261-5b11-9d18-ccf82723c55f,24/12/2021 02:26:34

I purchased these to try them out hoping they’d work out. The first day I wore them, I spent 5 hours on my feet at the range  wearing a gun belt and armor, in wet grass and the temperature was around 40 deg F. They were perfect...I couldn’t believe how good they get over the course of the training. I then wore them another 8 or so hours afterwards both during and after work. Overall, these boots are incredibly light, very good arch support, excellent traction, adequate in keeping feet warm during cool temps and all around cushioned enough to be incredibly comfortable during just about any activity. i don’t have any experience with these types of boots, mine is limited to those of the tactical boot variety such as the Adidas GsG9 (original), Blackhawk, Oakley, Viktos, Nike (FSB), and my last were Solomon. These blow them all away in the comfort department, though I know they’re not very comparable. My only advice is I run between an 8.5 and a 9, I bought 9’s, which fit me perfectly but that leads me to believe these run just a tad small. The difference may be negligible to most, but figured I’d mention it.

Svolgono egregiamente la loro funzione: hanno un buon grip,  sono carine, sono leggere, non molto traspiranti a mio parere, hanno l'aria abbastanza sintetica, ma per il prezzo pagato sono un'ottima alternativa. Le sconsiglio tuttavia a chi ha la pianta larga: sostengono il piede, con un elastico interno, che permetterebbe quasi di evitare di allacciarle, ma inizialmente stringe. Ormai le sto usando da un mese e sono portabili, ma all'inizio ho avuto paura di aver sbagliato numero, nonostante alla prima prova mi fossero sembrate giuste.

Ho fatto così anche in questo caso e mi sono trovato bene.  È inutile girarci intorno, non si può dare una regola precisa perché dipende dalla forma del vostro piede.

Gli stivali non sono lucidi ma piuttosto opachi quindi se vi piace la pelle lucida optate per altri modelli. A me piacciono così.CONCLUSIONIBuon prodotto. Grazie alla scuola Geox che lascia respirare il piede si sta bene e non si suda, cosa difficile con altri tipi di stivaletti. Acquisto consigliato soprattutto in offerta intorno ai 50 euro!

I appreciate how the entire sole is rubber and not mostly foam like other kids' sneakers. The sizing (like other sneaker companies) is strange. I usually purchase one or two sizes bigger than what my kids wear in most other shoes. My kids also gravitate to the ""wide"" width even though they don't have wide feet. Those last two things are specific to my kids and how they fit in the sneakers, but once I figured these out, we were set.The reason for the 3 star rating: After cutting the tag off these sneakers and discarding the box when my son gave them the thumbs up, I realized the laces are FIXED and UNADJUSTABLE. There is no way to loosen or tighten them because the tops of the laces are glued to the shoe!After wearing them for a couple days, my son commented on how loose they felt. The elastic is not hefty and they already started to lose elasticity. It would not take much time for them to become way too loose.Finally, I had no choice but to cut the elastic laces out and replace them with different laces. It was still problematic because the top hole (where the original ones were glued) was unusable for the new laces. The sneakers are still somewhat loose because my son can't lace and cinch the new laces as high as he should be able to.Bottom line: these sneakers turned out to be a mess. I've been pleased with New Balance in the past and will continue to purchase their products.

The cloud foam cushion it came with took me about five minutes to dislike because your toes roll over the edges and that’s soooo annoying.

They’d been in an old pair of sneakers so I could easily give that a try and let me tell you ... it worked splendidly!! I now LOVE these shoes. They are like walking on marshmallows. True to size. Attractive. Super comfy. Downside is that I ran an errand the first day I had them and something was poking me in the foot so I looked and an earring without a back had picked completely through the cheap sole. Not a huge big deal but worth mentioning. I’d say if you’re looking for a “house slipper” quality shoe ... this is it. Throw in a pair of insoles and they work great.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07VFW4F9F,Merrell ALVERSTONE WP,VWT,More athletic Hiker than the Moab 2s,"Coming from a Moab Vent and Moab 2 Vent user, I was a bit skeptical that any other Merrell could provide the same comfort, but man do these things rock!.I have wide and flat feet so my shoe choices are somewhat limited. I originally chose the Moab Vents because of their out-of-the-box bang-on comfort and fit (you could buy those at the store and head directly to the trail head, they were that good). As I got more educated on what makes a good hiking shoe, I started to notice that my Moabs were a little too stiff and honestly didn't cinch down enough for my ankles (They always felt loose on me, going down half a size didn't help).After my Moab 2s finally cried Uncle, I looked for a bit more athletic hiker, not a Trail Runner, but something more streamlined with a bit less of a profile and footprint. I came across the Alverstones and after reading countless reviews, I saw the magic words, ""Large Toebox"" and ""Great for wide feet"". I got them delivered and threw them on for a quick 3-miler on varied terrain, and I gotta say these are my new hiking shoes. The fit is on a another level, so much more secure than the Moab 2s, and the footprint is just streamlined enough to where I don't feel boxy and like I'm wearing hiking boots (The Moab footprint was a bit too big for my taste). The quick-lacing system cinches down securely and the design of the tread allows for fast-paced hikes, which is what I enjoy.I do agree with others that the insole needs to be swapped out ASAP, especially for someone like me with my foot issues, not a problem as I just swapped out the aftermarket insoles I had in my Moab 2s.It's only been one hike, but I love them so far and don't see any issues coming up in the future.",4.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 16 November 2020,10 people found this helpful,243bb397-40b4-5a29-98d3-5b603d279d6d,24/12/2021 02:26:41

I've been walking everyday in these shoes for just under 4 weeks, which I average about 3 to 4 miles per day.  I probably have about 80 - 90 miles of mostly neighborhood walking with very little trail exposure.I'm filing a defect return with Merrell and will have to see how this goes.As for the fit, I initially struggled with trying to like these, as these are slightly wider than my prior Merrells.  I'm an 11W, and I really have to pull the laces tight to get the right fit, but I've been satisfied with comfort after the first day.The first 1 mile I had these on I was very doubtful.  One foot felt off centered, the other ankle lace was digging into my skin.  However, after taking the shoes completely off and checking my socks the soles and lacing up again, I've been happy every since.  So, don't be completely discouraged by first impressions, it may just take a little adjusting.",1.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 29 August 2020,9 people found this helpful,dabc2b49-e460-580f-aee2-78f7ca43debc,24/12/2021 02:26:41

I have a neuroma in one foot and a fibroma in the other, along with high arches.  I need very wide shoes and lots of cushioning.  I purchased 4 pairs of Merrell hiking shoes at the same time, and this pair is the only one that was comfortable for me, so the others were returned.  I tried Moab 2 Vent in 2 widths, and Moab Edge 2.  I wear a size 8 to 8.5 in women's shoes, mostly wearing wide shoes like Altra and Crocs.  In a men's shoe I go down 1 to 1.5 sizes.

I order 10.5 US from Merrell for all my hiking and general purpose shoes, but these seem about half an inch shorter in length than all my other 10.5 Merrell shoes. And I found out that Merrell lowered their price of this shoe to $80 - so I did not save any money by buying from Amazon! Lesson learned! I will NOT be purchasing footwear from Amazon in the future.

The only place they have shown much wear is the back of the shoe at the heel. I have had my Merrell Moab hiking shoes for over four years and they don't look too bad for ""old hiking shoes"" but because I have used them more lately for mowing the yard and working in my garden they just aren't ""pristine"" looking enough for wearing to outdoor picnics, parties, and eating out with my wife. I saw the Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes and liked the way they looked and the good price for them so I figured is they were anyway as good as the Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes I would be happy with them. So far I really like my new Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes. The fit was good right out of the box and I have had no problems doing by 1.5 to 2 mile daily walks with them.

Vom 7km Fartlek, 10km Tempoeinheit und dem HM in 75% Pace - der Hyperion Tempo macht eine super Figur. Das Zusammenspiel von Dämpfung, Direktheit und Leichtigkeit ist aus meiner Sicht hervorragend. Doch der Reihe nach:Gewicht: Der Schuh ist nicht nur leicht, er fühlt sich auch genauso an und läuft sich, besonders bei schnellen km sehr gut. Die Mittelsohle ist nicht zu schmal aber das DNA Loft Material ist super und bietet ausreichend Dämpfung was nicht zu lasten des Gewichts geht.Dämpfung: Für reine Versenläufer ist der Schuh sicher nicht die beste Wahl, für Mittelfußläufer ist er meiner Meinung nach super. Die Dämpfung ist ausreichend, man spürt die Energierückgewinnung, wenn auch nicht so sehr wie bei einem Carbon-Schuh (kostet auch wesentlich weniger).Feedback: Die Sohle ist zwar nicht sehr dünn, aber sie gibt viel Feedback. So ist der Lauf auf sehr groben Schotterwegen eher gewöhnungsbedürftig. Auf Trailabschnitten sowie dem Asphalt spielt der Hyperion Tempo seine Stärken aus. Die Sohle ist sehr haltbar und nach den 150km ist noch kaum Verschleiss an der Außensohle zu sehen.Die Schnürsenkel sind sehr dünn und dürften etwas kürzer sein, selbst mit Runners Knot sind sie meiner Auffassung nach noch einen Tick zu lange.Alles in allem ein hervorragender schuh von Brooks - mit dem sich bei jedem Wetter laufen lässt und man lange (+650km) Spaß haben kann.Sofern die Rezension hilfreich war, freue ich mich über ein Daumen nach oben ;-)",5.0,True,Reviewed in Germany on 26 July 2021,4 people found this helpful,8346cf25-3738-5cbd-b3da-2aed4bb91c8a,24/12/2021 02:26:43

These are authentic, the box was in good condition all labels were on. They feel great when I put them on and I don’t see any signs of them being fake. Even have memory foam type material at the bottom feels good. I have been looking for some nice casual white leather shoes and these slap! I get mad compliments.

Our soccer also go back and forth between turf and grass during the season, and my kid doesn't like traditional cleats (notably on harder surfaces).  He also usually blows out his shoes during a season.  This shoe gets 5 stars for lasting a season and for fitting on a little wider foot.  The grip from the shorter cleats also work well for a kid on grass (even a bigger one like mine).

It's not an easy find. With that said, these shoes are sporty and quite cute. They look almost knit and the gray color is a nice neutral. I was really pleased with how the shoe looked.In addition to a cute shoe, I require a decent amount of arch support (I love Vionic shoes). I purchased these because of all of the reviews noting these had great arch support. I have one question.....Where is said arch support? If you are expecting a decent amount of arch support (like a Vionic shoe) - this is NOT it. The insole has a bit of bump - else it's pretty flat without a lot of padding. I was super disappointed in how flimsy the insole was. The good thing is the insole is removable, so if you love the shoe and need more support - you can easily add your own insole.",3.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 21 June 2021,7 people found this helpful,24510c15-1205-55e4-a3d3-e7c0e0f2efb0,24/12/2021 02:26:57

I listened to the reviews and ordered a whole size larger than normal (I wear a lot of NB shoes of this same style) and they were right I needed a whole size larger in length but they were very narrow. I returned them and ordered the same thing in a wide only to find that this shoe was not only wider but much longer also. so I guess you should order a half size larger and wide in order to get a proper fit?

I skate maybe an hour every other day but I do not do any crazy tricks, an Ollie and kickflip if I’m feeling it and this is just from a small time frame of wearing them. My previous vans half cabs lasted 9 months. I had heard good things about New Balance for skating but am not impressed with them at all.

They love gym and are always involved in at least one sport per season.  They are very hard on shoes because they live to run and jump.  We bought several pairs of the Reebok ATV after my oldest son saw the great commercial for them and decided he had to have a pair.  My boys wore the crap out of them and loved every minute of it.  Please bring those shoes back.  We have been hooked on Reebok for their comfort and durability ever since.I bought each of my boys a pair of the Yourflex Train 10s for Christmas to wear to school and for Gym class.  The different colored tread on the bottom of the shoes have begun to come undone after two days each.  It was obviously added last in the factory in order to enhance the appearance, but is a complete fail as it has lowered the functionality of the shoe tremendously.I've seen this happen with other shoe companies that attempt the same visual tactic.  In the future, I will not buy any shoe that screws around with the sole like this.  I'm disappointed Reebok.  I've grown to expect more from your company.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07G122JP7,ALLY UNION MAKE FORCE Mens Womens Walking Shoes Lightweight Mesh Slip-on Running Sneakers Gray Size: 8 Women/7 Men,MotherOfDachshunds,An honest review from a Shoe Addict.,"The sizing chart is wierd because it's Unisex Sizing. My foot is 9""x3"" and according to the listing's size chart, I should order a Men's 5/Woman's 6. However, I'm a US Woman's Size 7/7.5 and can wear a Men's 5.5/6.Since this seller offers free returns, I went ahead and ordered the recommended Size 6 (in case the sizes were Men's) and a Size 7 (in case the sizes were Woman's) so I could compare fit.The Size 6 was too snug and short. The Size 7 fits well, lengthwise but is a tad wide. I kept the 7 because I wear socks and wanted to use an insole for plantars fasciitis. The shoes do not come in a box, they come in a nice little bag - which makes them perfect for Returing the Size 6 was as easy as taking the unpacked shoe bag to Kohl's (although, since I have a printer, I chose to drop it off at UPS in the original reusable Amazon bag).A previous reviewer mentioned that they broke their ankle wearing these shoes. I can see how that could happen because the 3D-Knit weave of this particular shoe is very pliable and soft. Literally, the shoe upper feels like a loose fitting sock your Grandma might crochet. The collar of the shoe is so flimsy, a hard kick would likely send the shoe flying off your foot. So, it is impossible for me to imagine anyone running in this shoe or walking faster than 10-15 mins per mile. There simply is not enough structure to the body of the shoe for any type of performance activity. These shoes are not in the same league and will not perform at anywhere near the same level as Adidas Primeknit, Nike Flyknit or similar type of slip-on sneakers.However, it's a very comfortable, light weight shoe and perfect for casual wear and short walks. It is a great grab and go shoe and, unlike the higher end brands names, I find these to be convenient airport security shoes because they are incredibly easy on/easy off and won't make me a target for theft as I leave the airport or check into a hotel.The listing photos do not so the shoe justice. They are cute, fashionable and comfortable. I say this as a person who owns over 100 shoes at or near the $150 price point.If you plan on doing a lot of walking (over 5 miles), I'd recommend getting a good orthotics insole for arch support and heel impact (or wear a performance walking shoe instead). That being said, I recommend these Sneakers as a low-cost option for travel because they are light weight, great for casual walking, easy to pack, and perfect for security check points.NOTE: I was NOT compensated in any way for my review. I paid full price for the pair I'm wearing in the photo. I think some of the other reviews may be fake so I wanted to add a comprehensive and honest review.",4.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 23 May 2020,2 people found this helpful,8b15660d-a13b-5fe1-a62c-ea33b17abb2c,24/12/2021 02:26:58

People ask me about them every time I wear them. Most of the upper shoe is knit-like and airy and really comfortable.

These don't hurt his feet and they are good solid comfortable shoes.  It's important to have good shoes that fit for your child...and they you want to be as cost effective as possible because they need a new pair every 6 months.  You don't want to buy a brand that's going to fall apart or not provide any support from a cheap big box store.  So try these!  Especially if your child has a wide foot.

The first thing I noticed, pulling the shoes out of the box, was a faint yellow stain on the right shoe and some yellowing in the laces. It really isn't a big deal, since it kind of goes with the vintage vibe(ish) but when I tried the shoes on, they were SUPER wide in the front, and only in the front. In all fairness, I have really narrow feet, but my other pair of Sperry's fit me perfectly fine so I'm not sure if they changed something up.

Les sandales n'ont pas crée un attrait irrésistible, c'est vrai qu'elles sont confortables et la semelle est épaisse et souple. Le problème de ces sandales c'est qu'elles sont un hybride râté entre la sandale classique et la sandale de marche .La partie en textile est malvenue et donne une impression ""tchip"", Le ""cuir"" ne couvre pas assez le pied pour le protéger et les couleurs sont peu séduisantes . Le prix de base est exagérément élevé, le prix Amazon (46 euros) reste cher.Ce ne sont ni des GBB (pour la qualité et l'esthétisme) ni des geox pour le confort ou le coté sportif. Autant acheter un premier prix chez Decathlon.Au bout de même pas un mois, la partie textile est déjà bien sale et la sandale bien usée .",1.0,True,Reviewed in France on 23 July 2019,,68f696fc-7d5d-5c97-bbed-03fc668d7f87,24/12/2021 02:27:02

Took me a while to find the exact shoe but I did and now I have my running shoes back.  Very hard to purchase shoes when you can’t try them on.  These shoes have a soft upper that does not rub or irritate and they have a soft wide heel for the trail running I like.  They are a bit heavy but that is because the heel is solid.  The laces are a bit odd for a runner but once adjusted the upper combined with the shock absorption of the soul of the shoe makes it worth the time.  I have a narrow heel and it slips if not tied properly.

I assumed they would be similar but they are not at all. I wore them out for a 5 mile walk and they destroyed the back of my heel. The shoes are not comfortable.

I'm changing that to 2. I'm giving them a 2 because they are comfortable as walking shoes.

I was getting out of my car and bumped the door with my foot resulting in a small hole in the shoe at the toe. Nothing you can do to fix it.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08C7C63WY,"Clarks - Womens Wave2.0 Step. Shoes, 4.5 UK Wide, Stone Combi",Nicole,Not friendly to custom orthotics,"I purchased these for the rocker sole to help with Hallus Rigidus, swapped out the insole for my custom orthotic and tried them on.  They were quite snug.  I assumed (my first mistake) that they would stretch, and wearing them around the house for a bit with the tags on they did seem to loosen.  So off came the tags and I wore them out.Unfortunately that tiny bit was all they stretched and they remained far too tight across the vamp.  In particular, the liner crosses over the top of the foot under the elastic and forms a painful pressure point.  Since I now had $140 of unreturnable shoe, I preformed shoe surgery and removed the stitching across the top in that section. This let the liner stretch slightly, but not enough.  Even in my older, thinner orthotics and trouser socks, the pressure point remains when you wear them for any length of time.  I may yet perform more surgery to remove the liner from the toe area, because they are unusable for me in their current fit.Clark shoes run a bit small and narrow, in my experience, so I ordered half a size up and regular instead of narrow width.  This portion fit as expected.  If you do not need to swap out the insoles and so not need lateral support, these shoes might work for you.  The rocker sole does help with mild toe arthritis; severe cases will want to look for a stiffer sole than these.TL;DR -- don't buy if you wear custom orthotics, don't buy if you pronate, don't believe they will stretch when you try them on.",2.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 16 March 2021,2 people found this helpful,62e06fbe-cec5-5c97-b499-faeb167e7cb0,24/12/2021 02:27:09

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07VZKTD9D,"Lloyd Men's Alfonso Sneaker, Black, 9.5 UK",Donat,"Schuh ist super, aber Vorsicht mit Prime Wardrobe Bestellungen","Zunächst vorneweg, der Schuh ist super, passt wie erwartet und ist komfortabel und schick. Verarbeitungsqualität lässt keine Wünsche offen. D.h. der Schuh selbst verdient keine 1-Stern Bewertung, aber man kann nur das Produkt bewerten und nicht das Kauferlebnis selbst. Das ist ja grundsätzlich bei Amazon hervorragend und ich bezeichne mich selbst eher als Amazon-Junkie als Amazon-Kunde, aber was diesmal mit der Prime-Wardrobe Bestellung passiert ist, ist denke ich eine Rezension wert, denn das geht gar nicht, weiß nicht so recht wo der Fehler ist, das muss Amazon versuchen zu lösen. Folgendes ist passiert: Sehe den Schuh zum sensationellen Preis von 79 EUR (bei Zalando war er deutlich teurer) und lege ihn in den Warenkorb. Es wurde mir angeboten direkt zu dem Preis zu kaufen oder in Wardrobe zu dem Preise zur Anprobe. Denke mir nichts und lege ihn in Wardrobe, könnt ja sein, dass er nicht passt, also nutze ich doch den komfortablen „Zur-Probe Bestellweg“. Schwups bestellt und bekomme per Mail die Bestätigung, aber ohne Preis (0,00 EUR wurde abgebucht) steht da nur in der Bestätigung, denke mir nichts, denn habe ja für 79 EUR in den Warenkorb gelegt, also wird es schon passen. Drücke nochmal auf den Artikel und sehe Preis liegt jetzt bei 87 EUR, ok denke ich, da habe ich ja nochmals Glück gehabt und einen richtig guten Preis bekommen. Denkste! Heute Schuh bekommen, passt perfekt, also gleich ins Amazon-Konto und Schuh behalten drücken, aber was steht da. Schuh für 87 EUR kaufen oder zurückschicken. Hmm, aber ich habe doch für 79 EUR in den Warenkorb gelegt und bestellt. Aber nirgends ist ein Beweis dafür zu finden. Im Kundenkonto steht 87 EUR und in der Bestätigungsmail kein Preis. Habe das doch nicht geträumt, also Kundenservice angerufen, aber nichts zu machen. Ich kann gerne zurückschicken, die 87 EUR ist der Preis. Ok, das war kein besonders gutes Kauferlebnis, muss ich jetzt die Preise abfotografieren nach der Bestellung. Na egal habe den Schuh trotzdem bezahlt, er war auch mit 87 EUR sehr günstig, aber ähnlich Zalando (89 EUR) was aber gar nicht entscheidend ist wegen ein paar EUR mehr oder weniger. Aber sehr unbefriedigend ist schon, das man Artikel zu einem bestimmten Preis in den Warenkorb legt und dann offensichtlich ohne es zu merken oder den Preis bestätigt zu bekommen zu einem anderen Preis bestellt bzw. dann den Kauf abschließen muss. Das geht so nicht! Habe definitiv beim Abschicken der Bestellung (Knopf jetzt Bestellen) den Preis von 79 EUR angezeigt bekommen und erwarte dann auch, dass ich zu dem Preis kaufe und kein anderer, auch wenn Preise „im Hintergrund“ schwanken. Aus meiner Sicht ein Fehler im System und für mich ein Grund Wardrobe nicht zu nutzen. Also Vorsicht beim Bestellen über Wardrobe! Keine Ahnung ob ich ein Einzelfall bin oder andere auch schon diese Erfahrung gemacht haben, definitiv muss Amazon aber hier am System nachbessern.",1.0,True,Reviewed in Germany on 27 October 2020,5 people found this helpful,a6e3e8bf-9d9b-57ba-94a5-2a8f39351759,24/12/2021 02:27:11

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B081HGWT9X,"LifeStride Women's NEON Loafer, Blush, 4 UK",RobS,Nothing fancy but they're Comfortable as all get out!!!,"Written this before but it always bears repeating: I. HATE. These kinds of reviews.They're loafer style sneakers. They're black loafer style sneakers. They're a nothing fancy wardrobe mainstay that you really don't think about much. They wear out and you get new ones so, what in the heck can you say other than that? Lol.Design-wise, they were smart and put in a scant little inch in the heel. An inch isn't noticeable in the slightest- you don't even conciously feel it but, when you have a tendon problem in your foot or heel... OMFG does that little inch make all the difference!!!The designer was also thoughtful enough to make the interior sole ever so slightly fuzzy. Anyone who has *ever* gone without socks in warm weather (pretty common to do in this style of shoe) know why that's a nice detail that is sadly lacking in a surprising number of shoes.I know that doesn't bother a lot of women because they have forced themselves to get used to it but those hard interiors that make the inside all icky gross the *instant* your body even *thinks* about sweating drive me bonkers. Lol.Maybe it's the 110F summers where I live but whatever the reason, I am always grateful for an all cloth interior for an enclosed shoe. Lol.Anyway, there wasn't any breaking in for me on these. Another nice touch. I was able to wear them straight out of the box as if I had them for years.On the other side of things, they also seem to be wearing quite well.So, yeah, they don't look like anything special and, I guess in a way, they're kind of not but, they're nicely put together enough that you *don't* really think about them. Well, at least, you don't unless you're sitting in front of a blank Amazon Review screen which, for me at least, proves that they're actually a nice product that probably won't get nearly the reviews that they probably should. ;)",5.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 17 May 2020,53 people found this helpful,13234b3b-9ffd-5375-9dda-f7aa878ffa79,24/12/2021 02:27:12

Same story with the other pair of shoes I bought from this brand. This isn't just running small, this is inaccurate sizing. Shoes aren't like clothes, I know i have to be careful when i order pants or shirts because sizes can vary. But in every other store on the planet earth I wear a size 8 (US).

My usual size (9.5) felt a rather snug, not necessarily uncomfortable short term but I could not guess we'll enough what it would cause during longer wear. They seem to advertise having some kind of special arch support.. I'm not blown away by that, having said that I don't feel my feet fatigue either soo.. I guess thats working?On here I chose to go to a size 10 ""narrow"" just in case 9.5 really was too snug. I'm happy I did. The nose seems a little long but is just perfect while walking around. I have weirdly narrow long feet that also tend to get ugly gaps with low cut shoes. I still have some gaping but it isn't triggering me as much as it normally would.

I saw the reviews warning that these ran small, but the Mineral Mist, in 7.5, was $22, so...had to try. At first I thought they were just too small, but a lot of that is their thickness & stiffness. I decided I was keeping them anyway (did I mention $22), & within an hour of wearing them, they felt fantastic, & I think an 8 would have been loose. They are gorgeous, & the colors are as vibrant as pictured. My only complaint was that the left shoe was just a teeny bit narrower across the top, as you can see in my photo, but it isn't noticeable unless you're looking for it. And I'm not giving up my $22 pair, so I'll get over it. I can't even deduct a star for it.Love the retro style, & great colors.

I have had these for 6 months and according to my pedometer I have put over a million steps on them and they are still as comfortable as when they were new.  I would recommend these for trail use or even as a good walking shoe for pavement because of the cushioning. I will purchase another pair when it's time to replace these.",5.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 18 November 2020,6 people found this helpful,22b43f8d-2842-5e65-9a68-9006ef7f6bc2,24/12/2021 02:27:16

I am returning them and dont think I will order another size, cause they dont feel right for Zumba (slippery, no ankle support). But they might be good for other dancing lessons, like ballet for non-profs.

Despite the heel and pad, you will feel as it you are barefoot, but that is part of the design, so buy it if that is what you are looking for.  If you want/need something rigid that will offer support all around your foot, this is NOT the shoe for you.  It is, essentially, a leather sock, with something solid underneath to withstand the wear of dancing on.  If you plan on dancing a lot and want them to last, then have a cobbler add leather or suede sole to the bottom surface (floor contact) so that they last.  For the price, just order another pair when these wear out.  The fit is comfortable, however, you will want to insert some kind of liner in the front toe section of the shoe, at the very least, if not for odor management, then for comfort. The primary reason for this is the fact the very front of the shoe, where the pads of your toes rest, has NO insole, only rippled leather (extremely uncomfortable.  The insole of the shoe falls short about 2 cm or maybe 1"" of the very tip of the front of the shoe, so the pads of your toes will press on the stictching and ribbed material where the leather shoe is sewn to the sole pad.  Look at the pictures in the description.  Where you see leather ripples/ridges in the toe area....there is no liner, sole, or pad covering this area inside the shoe.  Your toes will not be happy.  An easy, cheap solution is to purchase, trim, and insert thin shoe liners that reach all the way up to the front of the shoe, and then you will be very happy with these shoes.  They are great for practicing or even dancing (socially), but be careful that others do not step on your feet because you will have no protection for the top of your toes.

Especially considering you need to have them start out fitting very tight because they will stretch.  I don't know any dancers who like their shoes to fit loose & sloppy.  You want them to fit like a second skin to your feet.  While your toes need to be able to spread, you don't want your  feet sliding or slipping inside of the shoe.Will need to return and order a smaller size.  I ordered 7 1/2 and I wear a size 8 to 8 1/2 size street shoe, but it is hard to compare that to dance shoes.  Dance shoes need to fit different than street shoes.  Also, the lining inside one of the shoes was all bent up & would have been uncomfortable to wear.

I just looked up this order and am amazed at how long they lasted, well over a year, but  the sole is getting worn down now. They still look pretty good and support him but he is 15 and still growing so I think I probably ordered them on the large side but they are super comfy for him while dancing and if he forgets to take them to class he gets sore if he uses regular shoes.But I need to get the tan color instead of black so I re-measured his feet and will be ordering up by one size and definitely sticking with this brand.For the price I think these performed really well--all the seams are still perfect, nothing ripped or torn, just use shows wear on the soles and on the  leather part of the toe, partly from his feet growing.  For an adult or kid who dances more than him they will probably last for 6- 12 months.

This of course can be good for some people, as can the narrow toebox ( these would be great for one of my daughters, however they are not available in her size).

I usually wear a 7.5, which is what I ordered.  But I could tell when I first put them on that they were a little tight right up against my big toe. The first day was the worst one. They were already feeling tight but I jumped down to the ground from a platform to run to the car and as soon as I landed, my big toenails (and yes, they were cut) hit the toe of the shoe and I could feel that little bit of pain for the rest of the day.  It's day three and I can tell they've stretched a little bit, but next time I'll try an 8 to be on the safe side.  Otherwise, they are extremely comfortable.  They're very soft and very light--I hate wearing heavy, clunky shoes.  They're the perfect shape, also.  Not too small and thin like a simple pair of old school Keds, but not too bulky that you feel like they'd only work with jeans or athletic wear.

This could just be a one-off, or perhaps knockoffs are going undetected more than I imagined. Maybe the negative reviews for these shoes are actually for knockoffs and not the authentic NB product?In any event, I highly recommend you visit your local brick and mortar retailer. Call ahead and ask if they have the 1100s in your size and request they order them in all the colors you are interested in trying. That's how I ended up with the blue ones.

Wie ich ihn dieses Jahr verbringen werde, ist eine Frage für sich.Doch, man braucht Schuhe, die man in der Zeit, in der sich Sonne nur zögernd zeigt, schon mal der ganze Tag regnerisch ist, der Schnee ist auch nicht weit.Wenn die Tage im Nebel versinken, tut es gut, wenn die Schuhe (es sind hörere Schue, keine Sneaker(s) im üblichen Sinne) in einer schönen Farbe signalisieren - da bin ich, man sieht mich. ROT ist die Farbe der Schuhe, und sie ist einfach wunderschön.Die Schuhe sind in ""H"" Größe/Weite, also weiter geschnitten, was mir/uns ermöglicht sie mit den Wollsocken zu tragen. Neben schwarzen Schnürsenklen, die fast dramatisch wirken, gibt es auf jeder Seite einen Reißverschluss, der sich sehr leich öffnen lässt.Man kommt in die Schuhe sehr leicht hinein. Die Füße danken es ihnen. Die Schuhe drücken nirgendwo, sie sind leicht und doch stabil.Meine übliche Größe passt hier.Es sind KEINE Goretex-Schuhe, man soll daran denken, wenn man im Regen/Schnee spazieren geht. Aber, sie vertragen schon etwas Nässe...Kälte, wie geschrieben, mit Socken.Sie sehen an den Beinen ansprechend aus. Perfekt kombinierbar, wirklich tragbar und wieder in SALE. Auch der reguläre Preis ist nichz zu hoch.So sehr ich Sneaker liebe, kann nur schwierig ""nein"" sagen, wenn ich wieder ein neues Modell sehe, so bin ich bei Herbst/Winterschuhen einer oder höchstens zwei Marken treu geblieben.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07FVYPSP4,BMS Raincoat 100% Waterproof - Red with White Dots - 40L - Long Arms,Alexandra Reichel,Die Qualität hat extrem nachgelassen.,"Ich habe zwei Jacken bestellt, in Farben Limette und Grün. Die Farbe Limette ist wie abgebildet. Dies ist Geschmackssache. Was ich aber zu bemängeln habe, ist der Schnitt und vor allem die schlechte Qualität des Stoffes. Ich habe die gleiche Jacke (in grün), die ich schon vor ca. 4 Jahren in einem Store gekauft habe. Die ist mir Superbegleitung beim Regenwetter gewesen, nur ist sie etwas in die Jahre gekommen. Daher habe ich mir überlegt, noch eine zu kaufen, war aber sehr enttäuscht. Die grüne Farbe ist etwas abgewandelt, aber das ist nicht sehr dramatisch. Nur die alte Jacke war aus einem sehr angenehmen und weichen wasserabweisenden Stoff. Die Jacken, die ich hier bestellt habe, sind hart und daher stehen sie ab und schmiegen nicht an Körper. Ausserdem wurde offensichtlich der  Schnitt geändert. Die Größe 36 sitzt jetzt anders, enger, unbequemer (auch des Stoffes wegen) und im Brustbereich extrem eng. Außerdem fehlen an der Jacke unter den Achseln zwei Öffnungen zur Durchlüftung. Sehr schade. Die Jacken gehen sofort zurück.",1.0,True,Reviewed in Germany on 15 September 2020,10 people found this helpful,e3cc4cea-7be7-5c4b-acc6-45f962aa22bd,24/12/2021 02:27:26

Das Material fasst sich sehr gut an, riecht nicht und hat keinerlei Knitterfalten nach dem Transport. Die Farbe ist ein sattes Melonenrot, wirklich schön. Habe 2 Nummern größer bestellt und die Größe passt perfekt. Sie ist hinten länger und sieht wirklich gut aus. Sie hat tiefe Taschen, in die allerhand reinpasst. Als  Regenjacke kann ich sie aber überhaupt nicht empfehlen. Ich war 10 Min. bei leichtem Regen unterwegs und komplett nass an den Unterarmen und vor allem an den Schultern. Jeder Windzug geht durch. Der Futterstoff innen ist glatt und kühl. Das ist unangenehm vor allem in den Taschen. Nach dem Tragen braucht die Jacke ewig zum Trocknen.

Ich frage mich, warum die Turnschuhhersteller an ihren Kunden vorbei produzieren, das kann es doch nicht sein! Aber bei den anderen großen Sportschuhanbietern ist es das gleiche Trauerspiel. Dabei sind gerade in dieser und der letzten Saison die Modelle so farbenfroh wie nie und man würde gerne sogar mehrere Paare kaufen, aber sie müssten natürlich passen, das tun sie aber nicht. Entweder drücken sie vorne von oben auf den großen Zeh herunter, was schmerzt, oder sie sind zu kurz und drücken, schmerzen ebenfalls, oder sie sind insgesamt am Spann viel zu niedrig, so dass man bei geschnürtem Schuh immer noch eine super breite Schnürlasche hat, von weitem sieht das dann aus, als hätte man Elefantenfüße, weil die Schuhe zu wenig Material haben um ganz geschlossen zu werden und das bei mir, die ich superschlanke Füße habe und jahrelang Ballett getanzt habe, einfach skandalös!

BOA is using string instead of wire which it normally does and you’re not able to get a proper tight fit. Second biggest issue is the fabric of the shoe lens it self to bunching up when you try to tighten it. One of the biggest issues is the tongue of the shoe is too puffy so when the BOA strings is trying to tighten it has to fight the puffiness, which lends to a loose fit.  Folks who love and use BOA on their shoes will understand. Last major issue which is the shoe doesn’t have enough arch support, atleast IMHO. On the plus side the sole of the shoe is one of the nicest I’ve seen, but at this point, I’ll probably stick with Puma or FootJoy.",2.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 18 July 2021,2 people found this helpful,35a8fd3e-e976-58f4-ac19-12f59eab6077,24/12/2021 02:27:31

However, the white stitching around the toe area wasn't quite as clean and neatly done as I would expect from Ariat.  I know these are only $150, but still, this kind of issue should be easily preventable.  Other than that, these boots are very comfortable, and took very little time to break-in.

Also, we now have about 5 pairs of the same size shoes for our 17 month old daughter. They all seem to be pretty close aside from these. They are a little big. The issue with is, for the most part they are meant to be worn without socks. The shoes being to big, and being worn without socks will cause the lacing system/tongue to bunch up and hurt.

They are the most comfortable walking shoes I have found, by far (and I walk about 15-20 miles per day on a treadmill desk). THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU SHOULD KNOW - there are two versions being sold here. One version is ""Made in the USA"", and the other version is made elsewhere. You can easily tell which version you are looking at because the US version says ""Made in the USA"" on both the tung and side of the shoe. The non-USA version is more comfortable, but less durable. Also the USA version runs about 1 size small. I enjoy wearing both about equally. The US version is better for running, the international version is more suited for walking.

I returned the normal size I always get since they felt way too big. Went down half a size and they were fairly tight. I stuck with the smaller size since I don’t want to wear socks with them and the hope they’d break in just a little (they have just a bit). This shoe runs slightly narrow in the toe box and no support for running which I assumed before buying. They aren’t as “breathable I thought they would be as well. The biggest issue I’ve had is even just walking my dog in them the insoles constantly would move. I’d have to take off my shoe and adjust it multiple times in just a few miles (I had to glue them down). I really love the look, but if you’re actually moving in them they don’t perform.

I got about what I expected, but it was not as good as I thought it would be.the uppers are all an elastic material Nothing hard even above the heel. You slip them on like a slipper. the laces do nothing and are just for show. Elastic pulls your feet tight against the sole. So it is essentially like a slipper with a shoe sole. Unfortunately, that make them kind of hot. It is a little hard to get the shoe on without getting a wrinkle in your sock and that will make your feet hurt after a little while. The thing I like least about the shoe is that it feels and sounds like you are walking in galoshes. they flap a little when you walk.They are not terrible and they look good.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00MUAYFKO,"Propet Women's Ladybug Walking Shoe, Oyster, 11 W US",Mary W. Plante,Comfortable and versatile walking shoe,These Propet shoes are comfortable. I ordered a 10 narrow.  I normally wear a 10 but measure a AAA rather than a AA so I knew these shoes might be a bit wide. They fit well with heavier socks. I can add an insole and wear them with tights or light socks. They do not have as thick cushioning or as much arch support as SAS Roamers but for one third the price they are good and comfortable shoes. They do not have a deep toe box. That doesn't bother me but it might be an issue for some.,4.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 26 February 2019,3 people found this helpful,d7731ce4-19ab-5a1f-b542-0a28e9f25917,24/12/2021 02:27:40

First off they are so pretty. The gold and pale pink combo looked great in person. I wanted a shoe my little one could slip on without assistance from me or having to sit down to put them on. Unfortunately these were not it. The neoprene back has almost no give so to put  on required sitting down and even then she struggled to get these on herself. I told her she could also wear them as a slip on and step on the neoprene backing but she complained that it felt uncomfortable under her foot. That was a feature I thought she would love to get out the door even quicker but again this was not the case. If the backing had more stretch it could be the perfect slip on water friendly shoe.

Like most beginners he started throwing in heavy lugged running shoes and had a difficult time turning his hips. His PR’s have gone up since buying the shoes because he can simply transfer power more effectively. So if you have a beginning thrower these ASICS will boost their throws and confidence.

They’re not only perfect for digging into the floor on heavy lifts, but they’re also super cute with shorts, jeans, leggings etc. I love em. I just absolutely love them. Wish I could find my size in some of the other colors because I would definitely add more of these to my “shoe collection.”  Some reviewers stated they’re like “clown shoes” because of the wide toebox- I do not find that to be the case but I do prefer a roomier toebox. Love the low profile (I loath thick soled sneakers). The first few wears I did notice a tightness across the top of the foot where the seam is but my the third time I wore them, they were broken in and are now my “close toed” shoe of choice.

The shoes laces are held in place by a piece of string and it broke a few days after we received them. I contacted Amazon right away and they instructed me to contact Adidas for a refund/exchange. I submitted my request to Adidas on July 11 as requested by Adidas customer service. When I didn't hear anything after a few weeks I emailed them again. Several emails sent asking about an update went ignored. I had to use the chat feature on the Adidas website to get an answer. I was finally issued a return label and sent the shoes back and they were received on August 26. I followed up with customer service again and I was told I would receive an email update after 5 business days (the time it takes to inspect the item) and then the gift card would be issued within 7 business days. This still has yet to happen. When I contacted customer service again, they now changed their story and said that because I didn't purchase the shoes directly from Adidas I would not receive my gift card until 20 business days after the shoes were received. I am now being told that I won't receive my gift card until September 23, which is 2 1/2 months AFTER I submitted all of the required information to Adidas to start this process.

I'd heard good things about Chaco sandals from multiple sources and decided to take the plunge.  Sizing charts are accurate although I found them confusing.  Best thing to do is figure out your shoe size in either centimetres or European sizing and backtrack form there.  I'm normally a size 9 in shoes, but got the size 7 Chaco per the size chart and it fits perfect.Things I've noticed:  The straps are MUCH softer and flexible than Tevas even on the parts that aren't using Velcro.  My feet appreciate that.  The sole has strong and definite arch support so if you have flat feet these might not be for you.  It's also a very wide last, which is good for my hobbit feet, but wouldn't work well if yours were long and narrow.  The foot bed is also very stiff compared to a Teva sandal which I assume means they will last a long time, but also take a few days to break in properly.For me, they fit well and are very comfy to wear.  I'm happy with the style of them as well.  I took a point off because I think they are a tad overpriced in Candada especially with the import fees being tacked on.  If I were in the US, I'd happily pay the amounts being asked.",4.0,True,Reviewed in Canada on 4 September 2020,,41c31988-b9a3-58c3-bcce-92508dd51e16,24/12/2021 02:27:49

As with all Eccos, I can fit my custom orthotic inside with ease and somehow it does not compromise the fit of the shoe whatsoever (I wear a half orthotic which only supports the heel and arch of my foot and does not go to the toe).  The arch support without the orthotic is fair on its own and the bottom is more flexible than the other Ecco sneakers that I have, but I expected that with the style of this shoe and was what I wanted.  The sole of this shoe is not rigid so if you need that this will not provide that for you.  It is an extremely light shoe and breathable which is perfect for the warmer months.  Lately these are the pair that I grab the most and get a lot of compliments on them. They’re different than the average sneaker. They are sleeker and extremely comfortable and work with a lot of outfits, obviously more casual looks but I did wear them with skorts and cute top on vacation recently and they were perfect.  Also, great at airports when you need to slip your shoes off when going through security and super comfortable when you’re just sitting in your seat for hours on the plane ride, and really light to pack.

I bought these boots because tennis shoes were leaving my feet too vulnerable.I was pleased with the boots for the most part. They provided protection and kept sawdust, gravel, and concrete out. The treads had better grip than tennis shoes, so I slipped less. I wore them all winter, where I had to go out in the cold several times a day, and these kept my feet decently warm. Wouldn't recommend them as winter boots, though. They aren't water proof, so if I was in the snow for too long, my feet got wet. Still better protection from the elements than tennis shoes.I'm a little disappointed with the durability, though. It was only about 4 months until I started getting holes in the leather near the sole. I continued to wear them for another 4 months. They're not completely unwearable, but there are several holes in both boots. I only got to wear them for 8 months before having to replace them - for almost $70, I was hoping for more.

I'm so disgusted that THESE BOOTS R SO FAKE! It's TOTALLY obvious to the naked eye, u just can't tell from their pic. Real Timbs r much heavier, have 4 rows of stitching (instead of 2, nice try) & r of better quality (leather/suede/nubuck) & also weatherproof. I'm not sure what fabric these r made of but it's cheap and the ones I received all appear to b wiped off which is weird because I ordered 3 pair from 3 different groups: toddler, little kids & big kids. Maybe if this were my first time owning a pair i could've been fooled but then again they're so cheaply made I strongly doubt it! I foolishly purchased these even after seeing another reviewer have a complaint of their boots separating after just 2-3 wears; I just thought maybe that individual pair was defective. I should've known better since Ive ALWAYS paid way more for ALL of my other Timbs. I just saw the price & thought they were too good of a deal to pass up especially since Timberlands prices have skyrocketed ridiculously this past year. I spent slightly less than $160 on 3 pair of these so I initially saved about $80-$100 total but what's the point when I'm gonna end up spending more to replace them when they fall apart?! I'm disappointed because I anxiously awaited my package for nearly a week and crap is what arrived. If u have never owned Timberland boots before then I suggest u go to an authorized store that sells them so u can at least feel & see what type of boot U should b receiving when ordering online. If u have Timbs then it won't take u but a second to spot these knockoffs. I received the 3 pair that I purchased for my loved ones today and 3 pair r going rite back TODAY!!!!!!!

I say this just to try to enforce that I like to think I know my running shoes. And I know this review is just my opinion, and that there is a perfect running shoe out there for everyone - this might not be yours, but holy cow, they are mine! I've been wearing Brooks Ghost and Launch for years, then started wearing Hoka Cliftons for long runs and recovery runs when I'm doing more ultra-focused training. I tend to find a shoe that works, then wear it religiously until they change it so much that I need to try something new, or if I get injured and that shoe feels like it has bad juju (slightly superstitious). I was overdue for new shoes, and went to buy the Cliftons but something prompted me to do some research and open my horizons. So I started looking around and came across the New Balance Vongo. I've been wearing neutral shoes for years, so was really hesitant to buy a stability shoe, but read that these are kind of on the neutral-end of stability, if there's such a thing.Anyway, with the <$100 price, I gave it a go because why not. It's now been about 2 months that I've been wearing them for just about every single run, and oh my gosh, I feel like I've hit the mother load. I recently ordered a second pair to have on standby for when my current pair is worn down, and am tempted to stock up on like 100 more pairs just so I know I'll have them for the rest of my life. The sock/knit liner is snug and keeps my foot in place, so I have no rubbing or hot spots. They are SO comfortable, they're like an extension of my foot. The foam is responsive and light so they work just as well for tempo's or interval workouts as they do for long runs. The grip is great and I actually prefer using these for trail runs over my specialty Salomon trail shoes. The only downside of these shoes (literally the ONLY downside) is that rocks seem to get stuck in the tread more often than any of my other running shoes.TLDR: These shoes rock.",5.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 23 July 2020,75 people found this helpful,db251805-26dc-5562-8dfe-5d7fe5e36c53,24/12/2021 02:27:57

I think it’s just too much of a heel drop for me. I went back to my old worn out shoes and the cramps were gone, so I returned the shoes. My son runs XC and track and wears the men’s version of these and absolutely loves them. He’s on his third pair. I really wanted to love them, but I got the NB Roav instead and they are fabulous. I wouldn’t recommend these Vongos to anyone with large calf muscles.",3.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 22 July 2020,11 people found this helpful,7d25f49d-bcaa-5ea2-a458-aa9b4ad105cd,24/12/2021 02:27:57

New Balance let me run, but I gotta say, they are moving away from structure and support and overpronation--which is what this shoe was listed mistakenly to address.  It's a sock with no structure on top of a foamy platform.  I'd worry about ankles with the platform height.  The sole won't hold up to track or terrain, or even miles of grass.

My toddler had the M-Trail Chaser Jr.  which he wore whenever we went on dirt/pebble trails (vs. his Nike sneakers ). However, they are heavier than these and I think less breathable because there's less mesh. (See side to side photo. This shoe model is in the foreground. M-Trail Chaser is in back of it). That being said, I think those may be more durable over time and more water resistant as these have more mesh which may tear more easily and let more water in, but we shall see.

Returned that and ordered the 5...perfect fit and plenty of room for my arthritic toes and bunions in the roomy toe box.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07FDY1CHT,adidas Terrex CC Boat Shoes Mens,Carrboxx,Functional and stylish!,"I debated these shoes and read so many reviews before I spent the money on them. I was planning a trip to Niagara Falls and knew I’d be getting wet and didn’t want to walk around with wet shoes all day. After reading so many mixed reviews — one bad, then good, then bad, etc — I have to say I can’t believe someone would write a bad review of these shoes. I’m not saying they’re perfect but you can’t beat these shoes for the money.Pros:They dry out quickly, they’re vented and they drain water, they’re stylish and they’re comfortable. I walked around NY all day in these and they were great. Are they as comfortable as my other running shoes? No but that’s not why I bought them. I bought them so they’d dry out quickly and they did. Everyone else’s shoes were still wet the next day. Mine were dry in a few hours and I didn’t put them in the sun  or anything like that. Just took them off when we got back to our room. They offered great traction while walking the wooden steps of Niagara Falls as I got drenched!Cons:They’re wide up front in the toe box which I LOVE because I have issues w my right foot and need extra room up front and these were perfect. Also, I didn’t tie these shoes once after initially tying them. They were plenty comfy right out of the box. However I read reviews of people saying they were slipping off their feet?! Did they not tie them?! Not saying someone else’s experience isn’t valid but I’m confused how this would happen. I can’t imagine tying these, let alone tying them tightly, and having them slip off your feet.And sure they’re not as comfortable as a more cushioned running shoe but these are WAY comfy for being vented water shoes. And you can always buy a cushioned sole to make them comfier.I’ve only had them for a few days but they were great for my trip and the traction was great on and off the walking tours we did. I like them so much they’re now an everyday shoe for me. We will see how they hold up in the long run but so far I’m very pleased with this purchase. Would buy again.",5.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 15 July 2020,10 people found this helpful,6d0652ca-595c-506e-a228-008842d6c8fb,24/12/2021 02:28:01

I’ve been a size 12 since I was 14 years old and that hasn’t wavered, but I needed to return the 12 for a 12.5 as my toes were cramped up against the front of the shoe.

There is a bit of stretch to the sneaker so the half size down didn't hinder me, though I would still say they're true to size and I will probably end up wearing these sneakers out a bit faster for buying smaller. If you're able, I'd recommend buying your regular foot size still.That said, I absolutely adore these. So cute!

After 56 years of buying strictly white sneakers, I really had to think out of the box for this purchase.  Fortunately, I did, and I love my new, blue shoes!!!  Realistically, I purchased these shoes for better comfort when walking.  I'm an avid walker, and my most recent walking shoes have not been a great fit for walking.  Plus, they were falling into poor condition.  Naturally, my first objective was comfortable shoes for walking.  However, when I found these colorful, retro blue shoes, I couldn't resist.  I've never owned a pair of shoes anywhere near the color of my purchase, but I'm so proud of them!  They look and feel great!!  Of course, in the beginning, as with all shoes, you must ""break"" them in.  The more you wear them, the more the comfort increases.  I have been walking in mine for about three weeks, and they're just now starting to offer the comfort and support I expect.  The look and color get immediate attention.  The first time out of the house , my good friend immediately noticed and was complimentary!  I have a weekly walking group on Tuesday night, and the first time I  wore these shoes, every person noticed and made favorable comments.  The bottom line;  nice, comfortable, colorful, fun shoe!!

I have very wide feet due to bunionettes on both feet, and most shoes, even ""wide"" width, are not wide enough to be as comfortable as I'd like. The first time I ordered a pair of these shoes, about a couple of years ago, I got the C/D width, never dreaming that I could possibly need anything wider. They were very comfortable, but I still saw the outside edge of my foot pushing out beyond the shoe. I figured I'd have to live with my ""problem"", because I was sure that anything wider would be TOO wide for the rest of my foot. I took a chance and ordered this pair in a 2E, and I've come to realize that I actually DO need a 2E! It pays to measure your feet, or have them measured for you. I think many folks are wearing the wrong size shoe! These are perfect.... I no longer see the outside of my foot trying to push over the side of the shoe, and they're not too big elsewhere. The Propet Washable Walkers fit so perfectly, it's like they were made for me! I've since ordered 2 more pairs in different colors, as these are now about the only shoe I wear.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B007BYQT62,Harley-Davidson Men's Bill Steel Toe Harness Boot,RussRand,Quality boots!,"Of the choices on fit, I had to choose ""Somewhat Small""...HOWEVER; if you do not have a tall foot (high in-step or 'club' foot), these boots fit perfectly. I wear size 9 1/2 boots...and these ARE 9 1/2 boots. My issue is the clearance at the top of my feet---pretty tight and taking a while to break in; so just be aware of that if you have a tall foot. That is my own problem. If I had a chance to try them on before buying, I MAY have gone a half a size up if it meant the top of the boot was more comfortable, but it's too hard to tell without physically comparing the two sizes.These boots get 5 stars, because (aside from my tight at the top issue) everything about the boots screams quality. First of all; I've always been a fan of Wolverine's, and that's who makes them (their web address is stamped on the bottom of the boot). Secondly, the materials, stitching, build, weight, and looks are all flawless on the pair I received. And last, but not least, these boots (for me any way), are so cool they give you a 'cool confidence' when you put them on...kept clean, they can be worn for any occasion from weddings & funerals, to Rock concerts and Rodeos.By the way; leather is not water proof (never has been, never will be)...best thing to do to make them as water ""resistant"" as possible, is to get some Mink Oil or any other leather treatment product, and treat them. They will repel water better, and last longer.I DO ride a motorcycle...but I don't think you have to be a motorcycle rider to own these boots.

I don't believe I will be invoking the 30 day comfort guarantee. Real nice boots for any price, but this is a great price. **** Less than 2 months and the leather is like ""peeling"". They have never been scuffed but there's like a thin shin peeling on the toe of both boots.

Everything about them is the most comfortable, like keds were when we were young, washes beautifully, and aids in a very easy on and off format. However on asphalt the soft gripping sole which is a very big plus, must be considered to be dangerous on  certain surfaces as they grip and as in todays experiences, I  fell on my driveway hitting  my head and face ,badly bruised and realized the sole got stuck because of the texture of blacktop, that is pebbley, due to weathering. Dragging feet can happen with us all and that must be something to watch for with these shoes.

They felt tight in length, not width, but I thought they just needed to stretch a bit.  Nope.  A couple days later my big toes were still unhappy.  I decided to order the 8, and they are MUCH more comfortable.  I wear them with no show cotton sock liners, and love that I can wear these inside and also out running quick errands as they do not look like slippers.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0042ESOTO,"Bloch Girls Super Jazz Shoe, Tan, 12 Little Kid",BAMOR,Very nice.,"Update:  Yikes!!!  I ordered two pair of Bloch jazz shoes from the warehouse.  Two different sizes.  They looked the same to me upon arrival.  My granddaughter refused to wear the first pair she tried on yesterday evening.  That review is below.  Today she wanted to try the other pair.  They fit and she likes them.  Then she proceeded to show me how the two pairs are different.  The pair she likes have the Bloch logo inside the shoe.  The first pair she tried on did not have the Bloch logo.  The color was not quite identical and the seam lines are  not the same.  The toe on the unbranded shoes is gathered, not smoothly wrapped under the toe.  I would include pictures if that option was still available.  We received one pair that is NOT a Bloch jazz shoe.  In fact, it does not have any brand name on it anywhere.  The size is stamped where the logo should go inside the shoe.  I have updated my review to five stars.  The Blotch shoes are very nice.Original review:  My granddaughter has always loved her jazz shoes.  It was time to go bigger.  These are a different brand than I have purchased in the past.  I purchased these from the warehouse.  They fit.  BUT, the seam that goes around the arch and under her foot, was uncomfortable and she couldn't get them off fast enough.  She informed me they are uncomfortable and she will not wear them.  Perhaps they were returned to the warehouse because of a defect on the seam?  Or perhaps the seam placement makes this style less comfortable. They look fine to me and seem to be the correct size.  [These turned out to be another brand, not Bloch.]I have reordered jazz shoes in a different style for her to try.  Unfortunately, these will be returned.  The warehouse price was great.

I guessed the same for both shoe types and ordered a size up. These definitely run large, to the point that you can see where her toes are and the edge of the shoe is flat. They’re not the easiest to get on and I’m worried if we size down much she’ll just outgrow them quickly, and she doesn’t seem to mind the extra toe space, so we’re making these work.

You kind of have to expect to get what you pay for.  Unlike other reviewers, mine did not have a smell out of the package so that was a plus!  You can however tell they are SUPER cheaply made.  The mesh fabric on the back of one of my shoes is kind of sewn/stuck together funny and it creates a crease in the back of the shoe.  There is no tongue so when you pull she shoe strings, it creates a bubble on the front of the shoe.  I normally wear a 9.5 so that's what I bought and it does feel slightly large.  They are not the ""cutest"" sneakers.  The sole is a little bulkier than what I typically go for, but if you are wearing pants, it kind of covers the bulk.  I will probably not wear them with shorts this summer.I will say, these shoes are very comfortable and so far slip resistant.  I am a swimming official and am on my feet for 4-5 hours on a concrete and wet pool deck.  I have worn these 3 times so far and have not had any complaints about the comfort or slippage.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07T7HJNQW,"Clarks Men's Forge Vibe Oxford, Tan Leather, 10.5 UK",Scott P. Dailey,"They're Big, but Quality...","SIZINGFirst off, they're huge! I'm a 9.5/10 reliably. I got these in a 9, having read the many people who mistakenly bought their size only to discover these shoes are way way way oversized. Even at a 9, I was surprised at their footprint (no pun meant).When I sit them beside any other 9.5 footwear I own, these Clarks clearly tower past them. So look folks, buy 'em a half size down from what you normally wear.COMFORTStiff at first, but then, duh right? These are well-made shoes, so naturally they'll need time to open up and accommodate the nuanced geometry of your adorable feet. I've worn them now for about five hours at the office and they've already gone from, let's say, a 8 in stiffness to a 4. So, given a bit more time, they'll wear-in nicely. At first they also did made an audible ""pop"" sound, when folding at the toes as I open my stride. But again, when I say ""audible,"" I mean vaguely audible. I believe it's again related to their off-the-shelf rigidity. Once we beat on them a bit more, they'll surely become more malleable. Insole is soft and forgiving, without calling attention to itself as some kind of atom-splitting technology. I feel literally nothing invasive about these shoes. There is no ergonomics in design, for instance, that are stabbing my Achilles, or rubbing painfully against my well-moisturized, Irish-alabaster skin.APPEARANCELovely, unassuming, practical, wearable. Durable, well-built shoes, with rather understated style appointments. The stitching, for instance, around the sole is a nice rustic touch that appears durably manufactured. the bright(er) laces is a cool touch too, as it adds a nice contracting feature to their look. And the bone-colored sole is again a unsophisticated, but just declarative enough a treatment to call modest attention to them.FINAL VERDICTThey're Clarks, so there's that.  As Clarks go, these are a deal! Get 'em, gift 'em, wear 'em, paint the town in 'em (or the office)!",4.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 11 November 2021,,bc90a632-4755-5160-9547-76b93835c93d,24/12/2021 02:28:22

I like that they are not the traditional water sock. They look just like athletic shoes but are very lightweight. 'Looking forward to wearing them on a beach this winter!Update:The main reason I wanted water socks /shoes is to minimize the sand getting between my toenails and cuticles.The first day I wore them during this, our beach trip, they were fine. Kept the sand out during the 2.5 mile walk along the beach. But the second day (similar to what James H. said), the seam in the inside middle of the right heel started to rub against my heel. By the third day, same thing on the left heel. There are seams on the inside heel. If they could be made without the seam in the middle of the heel, these would be great. When you are walking on sand, even compact sand closer to the water, the shoe will slip and then any seam will cause injury to the heel. I bought some gel heel insets, but they are curling and losing adhesion.

These are very easy to get on and comfortable.,My husband has a neurological disease which makes it very hard for him to bend down and put on shoes and socks. The Velcro tab on a zipper at the top opens the shoe wide so he can easily slide his foot in.  And they zip up tight enough that his foot doesn't slide when he walks (with a walker). He says they're also comfortable. We were very pleased with this purchase.

Smetana,"Zero arch support, not a work boot.","At first, I put these on at home and stood up on the carpet in them. Ahhh... soft, memory foam. Light weight. Flexible. The side zipper is tight. The laces are thick. The leather feels like quality. Should be good right? Not so much. I'm 14 days in and I'm writing this with sore feet. Instead of writing you a story, I'm just going to list the problems with these boots...1) Memory foam is too thin, results in zero cushioning on hard surface while making your feet sweat profusely.2) No arch support. The inside is flatter than dollar store dress shoes.3) No side to side support. This means your heel will move, and since they are light and flexible, you'll likely roll your ankle.-All this can be solved with buying a nice insert from Sof Sol, like I did... except there is still one more COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE problem.4) Small cracks in the sole. Yes, water can leak up through the bottom of this boot between the tread resulting in wet feet (I hope that was water...) At least I didn't slip in it.There is one really big positive these though... The top of the boot, where it meets your shin and calf is really nice. There is nothing sharp or rough edged to make that uncomfortable in the slightest. I've tried a lot of boots over my years of military, contractor, and corrections... and the top half of these boots are best in the business.

My toddler had the M-Trail Chaser Jr.  which he wore whenever we went on dirt/pebble trails (vs. his Nike sneakers ). However, they are heavier than these and I think less breathable because there's less mesh. (See side to side photo. This shoe model is in the foreground. M-Trail Chaser is in back of it). That being said, I think those may be more durable over time and more water resistant as these have more mesh which may tear more easily and let more water in, but we shall see. I also think these are slightly wider and easier to step into than the M-Trail Chasers.They claim these are machine washable which is nice though I would probably just spray them down w a hose.Hopefully you found this review helpful.",4.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 17 October 2020,5 people found this helpful,773aa602-1658-5b4e-b7bb-3cc7ec86c912,24/12/2021 02:28:27

After one day of just walking around a state park (with minimal stress), I noticed that the front sole was coming apart. He wore these for a second day, and the sole was apart for a whole inch. I had to buy super glue. The picture shows the shoes after I glued them. We were still on our long camping trip and my son had to keep wearing the shoes so they are a little broken in now.

I have flat and wide feet and ordered 1/2 size up from my usual and it's a comfortable fit. No more black toenails from smashing toes against the front of my shoe (yes, lacing the shoestrings correctly helps also). The Alverstone sole isn't as deeply grooved as the Moabs, and the Alverstone do not have the vibram sole, but I also paid $20 less for these shoes. I hope the Alverstones will last much longer than my Fila and Saucony walking shoes where the soles gets worn-out smooth after a 4-5 months of hiking once a week.I'm saving up money for a pair of $100 Merrell Moabs for better traction and grip. Merrell makes shoes that fit the shape of my feet; it's very hard to find comfortable and durable shoes that look good, as well. I want everything, haha!I purchased my Alverstones from Gear Coop, good seller. Earlier, I had bought the shoes from Zappos but got a defective/previously-returned item; one of the heels squeaked!

Calahorro,"Great for tennis, really high end at a great price because of inexplicable reviews","I don't understand people leaving bad reviews here, I just got them, put them on and went to play. There is NO CLICKING sound, if anything they are sticky to normal floors out of the box and the sole makes a sound as you walk, it obviously goes away on sidewalks or at the court and will not last. To those who complained about the toes being too tight or the ankle loose...learn to tie your shoelaces! They come with a normal cross lacing out of the box and yes, my right foot was too tight at the top, a slight pull and it was actually hurting on the side a bit, not on the other foot, but this is not how you tie your tennis shoes, on these I just went one across and then under the sides one up and across etc, the other lace straight up through the middle but there are a couple of aceptable ways, watch a video or something. The toe box is tight and slightly rigid at the top and sides, as it should be for a better feel and traction, it prevents your toes to hit the edge and hurt and the fit is perfect on its own, no need to get it tighter but  at the top of the lacing, however, the last eyelet is low, use it with the laces crossed and that will not allow your ankle to feel loose, but comfortable and secure without feeling the shoe. I had no problems at all lacing them right. No noises, they stick to the court like I have not felt before, they are light but you feel support and protection. Lots. It's amazing how quickly you take off in this when changing dictections. Tennis Warehouse gives these one of their best ratings on a pair of tennis shoes that I have seen.

I saw that it made top ten for tennis shoes 2018 and decided to try them for myself and I am not disappointed.There was no noise or weird sound from this sneaker as I walked.  It was perfect out of the box.  I also gotta say, based on a previous review, you must lace your shoes properly and those negative posts will not matter.  And looks!!! Plenty of complements as soon as I was in the public eye.  They are a great looking.Performance is great.  I feel secured and supported in this shoe.  Toes are wide and comfy, but fit perfect.  My favorite thing about buying online is that I have been wearing an Asics running shoe for about two years.  I bought them in a physical store and got the perfect fit (I've always went with New Balance or Nike in the past because of width).  Here I ordered the same size without trying on the Speed FF ever.  Same fit & function that made me chose the ASIC over the others the first time.  These are ASICS and they rock.The reason for 4 out of 5 stars is just based on price.

The weight is 12 OZ (very light) and you notice the speed difference it makes, you are just quicker. The shoe fits well over my low volume foot with just a slight amount of too much width for my C-D wide foot. I must carefully tighten the shoe strings to get a close enough fit. I did get a popping sound on the left show for a few months  but it has dissipated after breaking in. Do not just  overlook this shoe because of the negative comments about popping, it isn't that big a deal to me at least and it went away for me. If you want to be faster, this a shoe to consider and it is reasonably priced. The sole grabs effectively and the ventilation is supreme as I sweat a lot and no issues with this shoe unlike others I have tried, it really breathes nicely.

However, now that they are getting broken in some I am starting to have problems with them. First of all, the standard insole that comes in these is almost paper-thin. After 1 day of working 4 travel games, my feet were exhausted. Then I added a standard aftermarket insole to help the second day and the back seam rubbed a large blister on one of my heels. I will continue to use them but will do so with boot socks on and not average referee socks from Smittys or Cliff Keen.

I have really narrow feet so I went with the larger size that I normally wear with some brands. I will say when I first put them on I thought they might not work but the fabric of the shoes does loosen up a bit after you start wearing them. You have narrow and thin feet I suggest going up only a half a size unless you like looser fitting shoes.Moving in to the actual shoe. Absolutely beautiful true to color in the pictures. Extremely light weight. Very comfortable. Worth every penny.I am a caregiver for the elderly so I am in my feet a lot and I can tell you I have not gone home once with my feet hurting after wearing these shoes for sometimes longer than 24 hours straight.

I bought these during the prime day sale in the gray and blue color way.  These are incredibly comfortable and very cushioned.  I've been wanting to try Mizuno shoes anyway after owning brooks for a while.  The knit uppers are a bit thick so they aren't going to wear out soon, but conform well after walking in the shoes for a bit.  The half-bootie that wraps the sides of the foot and holds the tongue secure is very comfortable and unnoticeable even with thin socks.  The inside of the shoe at the toe is seamless thanks to the knit uppers and very comfortable and very foot hugging.  The heel area hugs well and keeps it from moving at all which is nice.  Overall the fit is very secure and the ride is very plush.  They do not have and stability control though so if you're an under or over pronator these shoes may not be for you.They are definitely true to size.

They are very comfortable! They do run a bit wide, and I have more narrow feet. The heel is extremely cushioned, which is great, but because the shoes are a bit wide for me, my foot tends to slide off of the cushioning and go forward in the shoe. So I'm probably not getting all the benefit of the extremely cushioned heel. The other thing is, the tongue of the shoe tends to migrate toward the outside of the shoe, which isn't the end of the world, it just looks weird, so I'm forever re-adjusting it. But again, this could be because my foot has some room to slide around in the shoe.I'd definitely recommend this shoe to someone with a wider foot.

The leather was incredibly creased on one of the toe boxes of the shoes, looking like the panels weren't sewed properly. You could see the stitching inside around the entire heel of the sole and there was a black stain on one of the shoes. Needless to say I contacted to Amazon unsure if these were authentic or fake Cole Hans, they assured me they were authentic so I decided to give it another shot and order a replacement pair. The second pair came in much better quality -- but do note that the leather is VERY paper thin and so there was still some wrinkling/creasing on one of the pairs. It was right where the toe box bends though so not as big of a deal. Also they do fit a little large so I sized down half a size (I'm usually a size 6 womens, I ordered 5.5)I haven't worn them for long periods of time yet, just around the house but here are thePRO'S:- Super light weight, comfortable- a beautiful clean, minimalistic look! more-so than Adidas Stan smith's- would make a great travel shoe, light weight easy to pack and would go with any outfitCON's- leather is pretty thin (hence why they're so light weight) so will need to see how these hold up",4.0,True,Reviewed in Canada on 24 January 2019,5 people found this helpful,ec1c5a18-6a32-5e43-96a7-56f4ba21b806,24/12/2021 02:28:43

Ein idealer Winterschuh auch für Frauen, die nicht ausrutschen möchten !","Als Berufspendler, der täglich lange Zeit mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln unterwegs ist und durch Wind und Wetter muss, habe ich lange nach einem Winterschuh gesucht, der meinen Ansprüchen gerecht wird:+  Die Sohle muss ein griffiges Profil haben, damit ich auch bei Schneematsch nicht ausrutsche.+  Außerdem sollte sie biegsam sein, damit die natürliche Abrollbewegung des Fußes nicht eingeschränkt wird.+  Sie sollte gute Bodenhaftung und deshalb eine möglichst große Auflagefläche haben (nicht so wie diese modernen halb nach oben gebogenen Fehlkonstruktionen)+  Der Schuh darf nicht durchweichen wenn ich durch ""Sauwetter"" und auch mal durch Schneepfützen muß,+  Die Füße müssen schön warm gehalten werden  (bei uns Frauen besonders wichtig!)+  Trotzdem sollte man auch bei einigen Stunden im warmen Büro keine Schweißfüße darin bekommen+  Und er sollte nicht zu klobig aussehen. Bei mir geht da das Praktische über das Modische ...Alle diese Punkte werden hier voll erfüllt. Ich habe sogar noch seitliche Bewegungsfreiheit, damit sich meine Zehen nicht zu eingepfercht fühlen, und man kann dank des Reißverschlusses schnell rein- und rausschlüpfen ohne mit steifen Eisfingern jedes Mal an der Schnürung herumfummeln zu müssen!!! Dadurch dass man (vorher) mit der Schnürung die Weite noch individuell anpassen kann, kann man die Schuhe auch mit dicken Socken tragen, wenn man will. Obwohl das Teddyfutter unten und innen rundum ansich schon mollig genug ist.Nur schade, dann man sowas nur unter der Rubrik ""Jungenschuhe"" findet und nicht auch unter Frauenschuhe  (ich trage Gr. 38, da passt das zum Glück noch).

Boost sole is super comfy, PrimeKnit upper (basically strong stretchy material) gives support but tonnes of movement.  Laces are decorative - I'm totally fine with that.",5.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 25 September 2018,2 people found this helpful,6a9e998d-95af-5abb-bced-234baf243c68,24/12/2021 02:28:45
https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07NSDJQJS,"adidas Originals Men's NMD_R1 Shoe, Black/Black/Vapour Pink, 5 UK",Amazon Customer,Great shoes!,"The Ideal User for This Shoes.I wore this pair of shoes about a few weeks and it was extremely comfortable for people who would like to go to gym to do some trainings or street run for about 30 miles a week. Personally, I do street run or jog in a gym about 3 miles daily and this shoes can protect my feet very well. Also this shoes is flexible, it is easy to wear without taking care about shoelaces. For people who are long distance runners, this shoes can decrease the vibration when you step on the ground and protect you knees. It can help you to keep stability when you are running and increase your balance.What Size You Should Buy?This pair of shoes fit a little bit bigger than normal shoes’ size. But I still recommend to go true to size on this shoes, because when we are doing some sports or jogging, our feet will be bigger than normal. If we buy this shoes for a half size down, it may be a little small and hurt our feet.What features this shoes has?For this pair of shoes, its breathability is excellent. When I am jogging at gym, I feel fresh and cool on my feet. I am a person who is likely to sweat when doing some sports, this shoes can keep my feet dry and comfortable. But if say the ability of water resistance, this pair of shoes cannot resist water at all, and if I wear this shoes on the street for a long time, I will feel cold because this shoes is thin and light, and it is ideal for summer.This shoes uses Boost technology of adidas to makes the shoe sole flexible and comfortable, and it has a fantastic looking so that when the first time that I saw this pair of shoes, I said “this is what I am looking for”. For its durability, I heard that the shoes with Ultra Boost technology didn’t do well on it. But for Boost technology, I wore this shoes for jogging and daily use since I received it and it did great so far. We can expect this shoes can handle heavy duty jobs.Thank you for your time, and if you have any questions, you can leave a comment below and I will response as soon as possible.",5.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 8 February 2019,One person found this helpful,3bc867b6-d7e0-5271-a401-32cf89cfde45,24/12/2021 02:28:45

Bought them mainly for the looks of an all white sporty shoe. They definitely don’t fit true to size. I wear an 11 and bought an 11, and they seem to fit like an 11.5-12. I would highly suggest you buy down half a size from what you normally wear. They aren’t very cushiony in the soles, but they aren’t uncomfortable either. Very lightweight! Good price. Would I buy again? Yes, just would make sure to order down half a size!Edit: I washed them in my washing machine, as white shoes don’t stay white forever, and not only did it clean them right up, but it also shrunk them just enough to fit even better then when I bought them! (Let them air dry!!) I left my original review so you could see what my first thought was. I am adding another star because these shoes (after washing them) are a really good shoe!

Even tied I’m able to pull them off fairly easily, even the high tops. The material feels like gauze tape which is surprisingly comfortable.

Yet after wearing  for several days straight doing remodeling work on my house, I found I had heel pain at night.

I had unstructured Sheridan when it was a stand alone company and it was the best and most comfortable dress shoes ever about 7 years ago. Looked like Clark's adopted all their 'comfortable' shoes under the unstructured brand. Sometimes, other brands like bostonian are sold under the unstructured brand which is misleading. I've spent so much money trying to buy the most comfortable shoes that look good and end up being a 50/50.Coming back to these shoes, I'm blown away by how comfortable they are and dressy. I have a function to attend with the wife and she wants the shoes to be dressy and looks very good and sharp. Very fortunately, it's comfortable as well so everyone wins.

Purchased normal U.S. dance shoe size. I wear size U.S. (woman's) 9 in street shoes and typically purchase 8 or 8.5 in dance shoes. Bought these in 8.5. For the most control when dancing, dance shoes are supposed to be just a tiny bit shorter than your foot-no overage. I bought them as an inexpensive practice shoe for the summer months. I dance at weekly outdoor salsa event and that dance suface is not the smooth hardwood one of a studio and can be brutal on shoes. I didnt want to ruin a new pair of $100+ dance shoes that way. Plus heat makes my feet swell, especially when I'm active which sizes me out of my winter practice shoes- remember what I said about sizing: should be no extra room in a well-fitting dance shoe. Interestingly I bought these after deciding to never purchase dance shoes on the internet again. The fit for dance shoes is so particular to your foot and the model shoe/brand you purchase, or at least thats been my experience. I've had only mediocre success with dance shoes I've purchased online. Sadly there are very few places locally where I can try on and purchase ballroom dance shoes. One is over 30 miles away, another has unpredictable hours and the owner rarely answers calls, or responds to VM. The studios where I dance have small collections, but not a lot of size variety so as much as I didn't want to purchase dance shoes online again, I was out of options. I was looking for a wide (stable), low heeled shoe that was very open in the front. I wanted enough material/straps to keep my foot stable, but little to rub on my foot and cause blisters. The peep-toe shoes with the small holes in the front have caused rubbing and blisters to my big toe in the past. My foot will always slide to the front of the (peep-toe) shoe and the place where it 'peeks' out of the hole in the front of the shoe, it rubs during dancing. These shoes do not rub or cause me blisters. They are stable and cushioned much more than I expected. They actually feel a bit plush and ' bouncy' because of the cushioning in the sole of the shoe, which I liked. The clasp is awesome because it allows you to choose the tightness of your strap and once you lock that in with the buckle, you only have to slide the buckle piece in and out of the clasp making getting in and out of the shoe quick and easy. One of the earlier reviewers of this shoe wasn't aware that design is intentional and thought her shoe was broken.The fastening straps of the shoe can be cut if they are too long. I haven't cut mine, but I did punch some additional holes in the straps so they would be tight enough on the top of my foot. All this is normal when dialing in your personal fit in a dance shoe. I'm very happy to say they've suited the purpose I bought them for and are holding up well in the month or so I've been using them. I haven't gotten blisters with these shoes rubbing my foot in the wrong way. Yay! Best internet dance shoe purchase to-date. I can finally lay-off using the leukatape I'd started wrapping my feet/toes with in my other dance shoes. Long nights of social dancing usually meant blisters. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with this relatively inexpensive shoe. It is inexpensive, but not cheap. Also, they may not be show-stoppers, but they are pretty enough, and most importantly, comfortable practice shoes, which means I can dance longer and happier! The mesh is holding up well too. Oh, they also came with an inexpensive dust bag-perfect for carrying to practice or to socials. If it helps, my foot is: average width, flat, narrow heel. If you will be using this for ballroom dance and have a very narrow foot, I think this shoe may be too wide for you. Average to slightly wider feet (across the the forefoot) will likely fit this shoe best.",5.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 22 September 2018,108 people found this helpful,3220ca0e-3830-5a39-878a-9c861a434f07,24/12/2021 02:28:48

The big issues with platform shoes were 1) they were made in every other size, and my size apparently falls right in between, and 2) they are very heavy.The primary reason to get these shoes was to get extra height as one of my dance partners is same height as me barefoot, and she wears heels. I also wear these shoes to practice different posture for balance and to just mess around.Comfort: these are decently comfortable. I don't mind wearing them but I find them less comfortable once I stop dancing and start standing around. My impression is I need a wider toe box compared to what some shoes offer and these seem to be fine in this regard.For reference, i usually wear men's size 10 and these shoes in size 12 fit me well.I do find that it is more difficult to lead in these shoes compared to standard men's ballroom dance shoes, in part because the leader must absorb the follower's energy and this is easier with wider soles, and because leader's spins are often quicker than follower's spins/turns which again demands better balance from the leader.",5.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 1 April 2019,6 people found this helpful,c804eed0-5449-54bd-8aa0-9562e3ec5357,24/12/2021 02:28:48

Only minor flaws.,"This shoe was really great! It fit perfectly and I love the strap that keeps my narrow heel in the shoe compared to others. They look really good on my feet. They blistered my two end toes, but for a cheaper shoe they are comfortable, so I put moleskin on the outer edge where it rubbed and that helped. My right foot is significantly bigger than my left and both shoes fit suitably.  In heels I’m almost a whole size smaller so I ordered a 9 1/2 which is perfect. The only thing that’s off is the plastic heel layer is very slippery on the dance floor and it makes it hard to put full weight on one foot when dancing. I’ve ordered heel grips, hoping they do the trick.

G.,Sizing chart is off--these are way too small,"I got these shoes for my daughter in middle school who is taking a social dance class. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on them because it's only a one-semester class, and she is not going to need them after that. These seemed like a good deal, so I carefully measured her feet and used the sizing chart to order a size 6.5--even though she wears between a size 8-9  street shoe. Her feet are a little on the wide side, but not wide enough that she can't wear 'regular' (non-wide width or 'B' width) shoes. When these shoes came, they were size 7 (not the 6.5 I ordered), but it didn't even matter because the shoes were several sizes too small. She could cram her feet into them after several minutes of struggling, but it was easy to see that the straps dug into her skin and her toes were off the edge. I sent them back. I wanted to order a size 8, but the style she had to have for her class (brown color and 2.5-inch heel) was not available (sold out/backordered). I didn't have time to order something else from Amazon (even with 2-day shipping) and wait for it to be delivered, so I ended up going to a local dance store and spending A LOT more money on something that she could try on that was approved for her class. She also needed heel guards, which were easy to find at the local store, but almost impossible to try to determine the right size and shape for this dance shoe on Amazon. Anyone who sells dance shoes should also sell heel guards to fit them. I would have loved to have gotten these in a size 8--I think they would have worked and been a good shoe for what we needed at a good price.",3.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 29 January 2021,,cbf36210-0c06-53d3-86a2-3d677186703a,24/12/2021 02:28:48

Keine Dämpfung, kein Fußbett - nichts außer nassem Pappmaché.

The attention to detail is excellent. Good mid range shoe. More on the aggresive side but not extreme. Although the way that the shoes molded sole was built makes it an even range shoe. So it does well on overhangs and small foot chips when needed. The sole has a little flex or it can maintain the drop as well.Sizing:Black Diamond typically makes their shoes so you can order them in street shoe sizes. Although there are thousands of different feet variations so choose wisely. As for me, I have a wider foot base, more natural volume to my foot structure and proportionate toe size. So my street shoe size 10.5 is slightly too tight. I originally tried a 10 but that was way to small for my feet. Even considering a little stretch in time there's no way those would fit me. 10.5 was a squeeze for sure a little painful but bearable but I want to climb longer overhang routes so I opted for an 11 so I can wear them longer during sessions. These won't stretch too much because they are synthetic. Also I live in California and when you climb outside in the heat you're feet naturally swell up a bit from the weather and or the approach so they are perfect! That's my two cents.

I have a pretty narrow foot so one of the shoe's elastic fit perfectly the other shoe's elastic was very big on me. Not quite sure the reason, but I still really loved the shoe. Another thing (which I really didn't mind, but others might) was the sole and bottom of the shoe is NOT flexible at all really. It is very hard and makes a noise when ever I walk. I do not mind this at all, but others might especially when buying a 100 dollar shoe. It got to my house fairly quickly and I was pleased when it arrived. Over all I really enjoy this shoe.

This is my second pair of Dr. Comfort's and they have pluses and minuses over the previous pair.Pluses:Extra ""depth"" to the shoe - Most of the swelling I have is on the top of my feet, with a little less to the sides. Having this extra depth keeps my foot from feeling mooshed into the shoe, putting extra pressure on the swollen areas.Velco Straps/Tongue design - Someone actually did a little engineering here. Instead of a regular flapper of a tongue this shoe has no tongue but a separation to the side of the shoe that opens wide, allowing a lot easier access to get one's foot into the shoe without having to yank the things on over your feet. The straps make adjusting the amount of pressure to hold the foot in place highly adjustable.Minuses:Inserts - Although these come  with very high quality inserts, they aren't as comfortable as my original Dr. Comforts. Not as well padded and not as good arch support. It probably would never be noticeable though if I hadn't had the first pair to compare.Inner Padding - The insides of my originals were soft as lamb's wool. While these are fairly comfortable, they are the level of cooshiness I've come to expect.The minuses are relative though.

Picard,best ballet shoes have split soles!,"I used to dance - not professionally, just for the activity - and when I found split sole shoes, I never looked back. They made my arch prettier, they were more comfortable, and I just loved them. So when my 4 year old wanted to take ballet, I wondered if they made them tiny - they do! I got her a pair of 8.5C - a guess on sizing - and they fit perfectly for about 6 months, until she outgrew them.

I can’t say now great they will be clipped in to my peloton (still waiting... delivery just got pushed back again) but I tried them on my cheaper bike that doesn’t use clip in pedals and they seem sturdy but breathable.I initially ordered a larger size since a lot of the other shoes I’ve tried tended to run narrow and small. These do not. I have wider feet and these are by far the most comfortable. They seem like they’re pretty sturdy and they’re easy to get on/off unlike other cycle shoes I have tried.Important to me is they fit my orthotics/inserts. I struggle with plantar fasciitis flare ups every now and then so I wear orthotics whenever I do any exercise, so if anyone was wondering, mine fit in this shoe just fine.No, they do not come with clips, so purchase those separately.

I cannot recommend these shoes because they just become too hot.  The heat results in excessive sweating and the shoes smell bad as a result.  Find another pair.  Reducing review to two stars.-----------Original review:I ordered these Merrell Men's Moab fST Waterproof Hiking Shoes to replace a set of Keen hiking shoes that I had worn out.  The Keens are excellent shoes and very comfortable, but they tend to get extensive wear on the soles (particularly for me, the heels wear out within 9 mos).  This review is my initial impression and I will update if anything changes.FIT:  The shoes fit as expected.  They seem a bit tighter than the Keen equivalent but are as expected for the size.COMFORT: These waterproof shoes get hot and are hotter than the Keen equivalent waterproof shoe.  The foot bed is definitely not as good as the Keen, probably the most notable difference.WATERPROOF: So far, so good.  I had to wade into shallow water and my feet were dry until the water got deep enough to overtop the shoe.OVERALL QUALITY: I have high hopes that the heel on this shoe will not wear as quickly.  Quality of the shoes seems very high.I rate these shoes as 4 stars out of 5, with the subtraction coming for the less comfortable foot bed than the competition and the lessened breathability resulting in more heat in the foot.  I can't help but feel that if the shoe had a breathable but waterproof fabric, the shoes would feel cooler and more comfortable for extended wear.",2.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 26 March 2018,4 people found this helpful,3773b0d7-d083-527d-85fb-fd4fb443ce70,24/12/2021 02:28:59

Peterson,Nice looking casual / athletic shoe,"I've been a Merrell wearer for around 10 years, now and have wanted to try their more casual line.  I typically buy Moabs or Chameleon Stretch Gore-Tex and expected these to feel a lot more flimsy.  While they are a little lighter, they still feel durable and look to be well made.  The laces are heavy-duty and a good length.  The Vibram soles feel a little softer than what the Moabs use, but I haven't noticed quick wear on them.  I haven't tested them for water resistance, at this point, but will update if I do.Pros:Lighter than the outdoor hiking shoes.Look sharp and athletic.Good gripping soles.Fits as expected.Comfortable for hiking and light running.Cons:The fit is a little less secure than the outdoor shoes, do to the lack of the ""heel lock"" lace hole.  I wish it was there, but since I wanted these for a casual shoe, it's not a deal-breaker.Arch is a little higher than I expected.

Ridiculous,They sewed the damn shoe laces into the back of the shoe. Now in order to switch to the type of laces I prefer I have to cut the original laces so that I can put the ones I like in. I'll wait for a bit before I do that but this is not starting off well.What even worse is they didn't even make the laces even before sewing the lace into the back end of the shoe so on one foot the lace is a solid 6 inch longer on one side. I can get past this for a comfortable shoe but it's a severe annoyance that when I do replace the laces that I cannot run them the way they were intended to go...Stupid move on the manufacturers part.

Firstly, the shoe has a serious design flaw.  The laces are sewn in place and not replaceable!  The laces wrap all the way around the heel, as a real moccasin would, but they are sewn in at the heel.  If your lace wears out, as mine did, the shoe is worthless.  The first time this happened, New Balance was kind enough to replace the shoe.  The second time, the shoe was  pretty well worn out, so I just bought a new pair.  That's when I discovered the second problem.  After only wearing the shoe a week (a week!) the leather ripped out along the stitching near the base of the tongue on the left shoe.  OK, no problem, I returned the shoe to Amazon and got another pair.  The 2nd pair popped a stitch at the same place on the right shoe BEFORE I GOT THE SHOE ON MY FOOT!!  Just opening up the shoe caused a tear.  Now I have to return the second pair too, this time for a refund.It looks like NB is having some manufacturing problems, (you can see how some stitching is off a tiny fraction, actually weakening the leather by crossing the pre-punched holes where pieces are stitched together) so as much as I liked this shoe when I first bought it several years ago, I won't be buying it again anytime shoe.",2.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 14 May 2015,30 people found this helpful,34e6f8ff-e6b8-55ce-8f78-cd9614c81f41,24/12/2021 02:29:03

The shoes are actually very good quality with excellent functionality.  The fit is as expected and it wears like a comfortable tennis shoe.  The sole is non-slip rubber and it grips great.  I spent 7 days on my boat in wet conditions right after buying these shoes and they preformed like a champ.  The leather is water-proof.  The shoe will not get water-logged.  The nylon vents (light brown areas) allowed for water drainage (I did walk in the water a few times just to see how they functioned).  There's also what New Balance calls a ""rollbar"" in the heal.  Basically, it provides stability to prevent your ankle from rolling right or left.. oddly, I found this feature very beneficial.  When you're walking on a slipper surface, your ankles can do funny thing.  This rollbar functions from below your heel... it's not like an ankle brace, but it works great.  So the design and functionality is excellent.  I'm not sure about the quality since I've only owned them for about a month. They're made in China.  If New Balance made them in the USA (like the 990s), I would've given these shoes 5 stars.",4.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 23 April 2015,17 people found this helpful,41f9f8a8-b2b4-5baf-a2ea-f66812b85ba7,24/12/2021 02:29:03

I Originally bought the adistar 2008s over 10 years ago and I'm trying to use different shoes when I'm not aggressively lifting since they are triple or more the price from when I got them and I want them to last. The Adipower is ok by comparison. The toe bot accommodates my wide feet and I'm able to reasonably tighten them so my foot feels secure. I trust them more than the shoes with the weird tightening mechanism. You may not fall in love with them, but they aren't that expensive and have a non compressible heel. I think some other people talked about doing things other than lifting. They have little in the way of padding, which is good. I wouldnt suggest doing cardio or walking in them (I get sore from the foot up if i walk too long in lifting shoes). You can bend your foot enough for the split jerk if you Olympic Lift. It does well for squats and is good for push press, wall balls, etc",4.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2020,7 people found this helpful,099780b7-811a-5f3d-86bf-763393744445,24/12/2021 02:29:03

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07PWMSXVP,ASICS Gel-Kayano 5 360 Men&#39;s Running Shoes,Scott,Great comfy pair of tennis!,"I gave these shoes 4 out of 5 stars because of the insoles.  I have sensitive feet, am on my feet quite a bit throughout the day, and have a bad back so I’m critical about my footwear and often purchase premium insoles for my most worn shoes, boots, and even my house slippers.  The shoes themselves are excellent - ASICS gel never disappoints!  These have a very breathable construction to prevent foot sweating (and future stink) that some shoes may not provide.  My feet sweat more than the average joe so I consider breathable construction critical as well.  I love the color choices and the one I chose looks great with a pair of jeans and  a t-shirt and are not a total eye catcher.  Some women with a big bust may be able to relate to this similarity.  Sure, it’s great to show off and look good, but I like a fairly modest look.  If you are looking for a great brand of tennis shoes that are durable, lasting, colorful, comfortable, and cozy, consider ASICS gel brand shoes.  For those of you with lower back pain who visit chiropractors whom do mention finding a comfortable pair of footwear and insoles, I have not tried much but the Dr. School’s branded insoles.  They have several types and the packaging is designed where a buyer can squeeze the insoles anf feel the material they are made of.  Anyway, these shoes are not the first pair of ASICS gel shoes I have owned over the years and they do not disappoint.  If I had a kid, I would bring him or her up in ASICS for sure- and perhaps some cute looking gorilla slippers or maybe even some of those shoes that resemble lizard feet and “growl” when the kids stomp their feet.  I also like Nike Air, Sketchers, and k-Swiss “tubbers”.  They are also kind to a middle-aged man wit s bit of back pain.  Lift with your knees, wear comfortable shoes, stretch a couple minutes in bed when you first wake up, don’t sit on a huge wallet that makes you bum uncomfortable, take it easy, and visit a chiropractor twice within a week when back problems become an issue and you’ll be happy.  It wouldn’t hurt getting a massage either from time to time either.  Oh, and be critical on the chairs you sit on often and adjust your automobile lumbar support properly too.  You can do a lot of little things on your own like that and they even sell automobile seat mats that massage your butt and back too.  But yeah, a good pair of shoes is top on the list and ASICS gel does not disappoint!",4.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 8 July 2021,,fbab4475-61bd-5130-a2c5-bc427836da82,24/12/2021 02:29:07

I'm a huge fan of the Kayano series. So when I saw these, I was very intrigued. I wear them for the gym and they're great for it—I wouldn't recommend running for long distances in them like regular Kayanos—because they're a lot stiffer.Only reason why I gave it four stars is because the sole/tread seems to be made of a different, slicker material. So when you walk outside on wet surfaces, it's much more slippery than any other Asics I've had—much less other regular Kayanos.Otherwise, it's a great shoe for the gym because of the tread pattern under the arch. Love the design and looks of it too.",4.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 25 January 2020,4 people found this helpful,086f7bf8-6b2d-5664-a5e1-027d624bece5,24/12/2021 02:29:07

I usually wear size 11.5 but upon trying these decided that the extra room might be causing extra movement leading to a burning sensation and ultimately, blisters on my little toes. I then exchanged them for size 11 which feel snug and good initially. The padding is thick and feels very cushioned on walking or running. However, after about 45 mins and 5 miles of running, my feet like they are on fire. My little toes have been getting painful blisters. I think the inner material is causing a lot of friction and heat buildup. I tried giving them a chance and had them for a month or so but I am going to go back to my older climacool Adidas that have perforated soles and have never given me any problems.",3.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 6 February 2020,3 people found this helpful,2a78e383-3b21-56f3-b2f8-a925aa760c24,24/12/2021 02:29:07

This is a very small number of boots given I grew up where we consistently had snow cover during the winter. I have worn each pair of those boots, maybe, a maximum of three or four times each before chucking them out even though they were all 'good quality' boots and in excellent shape. I found that the slip-on boots quickly became loose, the ones with many eyelets took me forever to put on and take off and the ones with only a few eyelets never really felt they were on quite right. I can also say they were all uniformly pretty uncomfortable, particularly when you consider I would rather have cold, wet, feet in freezing temperatures then wear those boots. That really should tell you something. Anyway a few years back I moved to a place in country Victoria, Australia. Although it is not quite as wet and as cold as where I grew up, I do often end up traipsing through sodden fields and forests. Early onset senility must have begun to set in, because, after having wasted so much money boots in the past, I thought it would be a good idea to waste some more money on a new pair I would hate. After spending what seemed like a week on the internet looking at boots 24/7, I finally settled on a pair of ECCO Jamestown Hydromax Chukka's. Simply put, they are unbelievably comfortable, such that they have only come off when I have showered or slept. This is despite having more than half-a-dozen more appropriate and expensive pairs of shoes/slippers for whatever it was I was doing at the time for which boots really the footwear for the job.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07T963RZ9,"adidas Men's Sprintstar m Running Shoe, Black/White/Signal Coral, 10 UK",Kevin & Liz,Not bad but not great,These are good if you're looking for an entry-level Sprint Spike. Reason I only give it three stars though is because the strike plate is not solid across the bottom. It is rubber and can bend through the arch and heel. This makes it good for a 400m but not for a 100 and 200 meter race. In a 100 and 200m race having a solid strike plate through the heel Forces you to stay on your toes. It is a lot harder to stay on your toes all the way through 400 race. So the flexion in this strike plate being made of soft rubber allows the heel to flex and touch the ground. But I needed a shoe for a shorter Sprint that has a solid strike plate all the way through to the heel.,3.0,True,Reviewed in the United States on 19 March 2020,6 people found this helpful,c9276163-085a-523f-950d-a4fcf5ea7d66,24/12/2021 02:29:15

I got them for martial arts and they will also be good for weight training. They grip great, but still allow twisting without catching on the mat.

They put your feet flat on the floor as if you were barefoot while giving ankle support; similar feel to Converse, except they contour to your feet and are more lightweight. However the soles will put you at a slight deficit, so keep that in mind if you plan on deadlifting.Personally I wear a 10.5 in most shoes, including Vans, Reebok and Nike. Occasionally I have to size down, like with Doc Martens (size 9-10) and Converse (9.5). I was skeptical of purchasing these online after reading negative reviews about the fit, so I went half a size up to be safe. After trying them on, I think they're overblown. I'm happy with the 11s, but I honestly think I could've broke in my usual size, since they're pretty malleable.

Unfortunately they had no proper size, so I ended up ordering shoes online.The order came in time and in a good shape, but on my second visit to bouldering gym I noticed that one of the laces started to tear. I didn't pay enough attention to that and that was my big mistake. You can see on the pictures how the lace look like after just 5 bouldering sessions. It's almost totally ruined on the left shoe and started to tear on the right one.This is especially surprising as I do not tie shoes tightly (they're 3 sizes smaller).Obviously it's too late to return them now after 1.5 months and visible signs of usage (is it even possible to have no such signs on climbing shoes?)Later I found out that this issue is so common for La Sportiva Solutions that some shoe repairs even have a separate price for replacing laces on this particular model. Unfortunately there are no specialized shoe repairs nearby and sending shoes to anywhere else is too expensive, so now I end up with brand new shoes without laces.Summarizing: do not buy this model if you're not ready to replace  laces right after the purchase.",2.0,True,Reviewed in Germany on 5 October 2019,2 people found this helpful,c6d91604-c42f-5698-b5dc-10cdd92980ba,24/12/2021 02:29:24

He has a pair of other slip on sneakers that are similar and worn out! I ended up ordering these 1.5 sizes bigger than his other shoes, due to the other ones getting small, and from previous puma experience, they always seem to run small! I probably would have been better off only ordering a 1/2 size or 1 whole size bigger, because these shoes flap in the back when he walks! Because of this, I am unsure if these really do run small or are true to size! My 4 year old said they are very comfortable though, and they do have a nice thick cushion inside! The only thing I am not sure I like or not since he hasn't worn them out, is the tongue in the shoe. It doesn't pull up very far and I am not sure if it is going to bother him or not!

Suela de retorno excepcional y pisada súper confortable.Upper fantástico y suficientemente ancho para entrenamiento o Carrera largos (más de cuatro horas).

I had to put them on, on the back of my truck to get enough leverage to get them on.I took the shoe from a 1 star to a 4 star. In my photos you'll notice the white lace eyelet. Remove the shoe string all the way, then cut the white lace. Its actually sewen to the inside of the shoe which is why it gets so friggin tight. Then feed your shoe string through one of the holes where the white lace was and lace them like normal shoes. They over thought this for too long. I have the JJ2s and theyre tight too.

Me quedaron a la medida, eso sí, si quieres que te sobre un poco de espacio entonces no te recomiendo hacer eso y pídelo tal cual tu número.
