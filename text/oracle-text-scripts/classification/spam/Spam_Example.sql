            q'!Hi,
I created a portal application with 11.1.1.7.0, I run this app with integrated server, I changed the integrated server to 10.3.6 instead of original 10.3.5 as this blog "[The Incident Archive: Jdeveloper 11.1.1.6 upgrade integrated server to 10.3.6](http://javaosdev.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/jdeveloper-11116-upgrade-integrated.html "http://javaosdev.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/jdeveloper-11116-upgrade-integrated.html")". I saved the CSS files for page template in /oracle/webcenter/portalapp/shared/pagetemplates/css folder, as "Oracle WebCenter Portal Online Training", "Creating and Using Page Templates in Oracle WebCenter Portal Applications". However, after I updated the CSS files and redeploy the app. I found the application was still using the old CSS files. If I save the CSS files in other folders (\<app root>/css), it works fine. I tried clean the integrated server temp files, also clean the MDS as this "[Java ADF Webcenter UCM SOA Weblogic: ADF : Clean your drs , mds folder using Script](http://hasamali.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/oracle-adf-clean-your-drs-mds-folder.html "http://hasamali.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/oracle-adf-clean-your-drs-mds-folder.html")". It doesn't work. Any idea how can I do with this? Thanks.!'

            q'!Hello Gurus,  
Let me expalin You our weird situation.  
We are using MSA1000, RAID 10, ORACLE RAC 10.0.2.3 (2 DB servers ) on Win2003 server. Durign the installation We leaved the disks partitions unfomrated and now Windows disk type is RAW. There are 3 arrays that should be on specific order with specific disk letters H, I, J (because of the application I guess).  
The 'I' partition have to be extended. We changed the disks with the bigger ones. Now the partition have the same size like the old one but there is Unallocated space. So I have to resize the  
disk to use the full disk amount. I installed Acronis (server version). The allocated disk space is recognized as "Partition 0x6 FAT16", the other part of the disk is "Unallocated". When I tryed to extend the fields were disabled.  
Do you have any suggestions how to extend the disk size?  
Thank you very much in advance!'

I have a resultset and 6 different dropdowns. To fill in these dropdowns I use something like

\<% } %>

I use this resultset for 6 times and it only works for one, when I change the name of it for the next dropdown ,it works very well..Isn't it possible to use the same resultset more than once on a jsp page??!'

            q'!JSF Scalability?!',
            q'!Are there any concerns with JSF scalability? Has Oracle ADF / JDev implemented any specific design features to help make JSF as efficient / scalable as possible? Note the context for my questions are that we are about to launch an internet site that (hopefully) will have significant traffic. I have not executed performance / scalablity testing yet, but plan to at the completion of the development cycle. Some users though with DSL, Satellite connections are already experiencing some performance issues. Is this due to the amount of data that JSF sends to the client? The rich user interface is great for intranet applications (high-bandwidth), but will it perform for low-bandwidth connections. We have a significant investment in JSF, so I'm just trying to alleviate my concerns about whether the application can scale - I know there are many things in my control as the developer such as the code itself and the ADF tuning parameters - my questions though are about the underlying technology in general. At my company we have received several 'thin-client' web applications (not JSF based) that were horrendous performers from the aspect that they transport a very large amount of data with each page request. I don't want to make the same mistakes. Any thoughts?  
  PS here's an excerpt from a web site that better articulates some of my technical concerns:  "As someone that built a large enterprise application with JSF, I can say that it was great for rapid development. Having so much context information available with every request was great when developing a complex application with constantly changing business requirements. However, we ran into major scaling issues with JSF due to this context information. With complicated views, the JSF Component Tree gets very large, which leads either to large sessions, or a large data transfer on the client with each request/response. With large sessions, you hurt your clustering efforts, with large client data transfers, you reduce the number of clients that a single node can support. Much of this problem can be reduced by reducing the context information that JSF transmits with each request. Essentially, each request only needs a \_very\_ limited amount of the JSF Component Tree's context, but you always get the whole thing. Furthermore, a lot of data that is essentially hard-coded in a JSP, CSS styles, attribute values, etc. Rather than being stored directly in the compiled JSP, it must be stored in the JSF component tree where it is usually unprocessed and passed directly into the outputted HTML. JSF is great for prototyping, but you cannot ignore that web development is limited by HTTP's inherent transaction-based nature. You cannot use a rich-client programming model to interact with a controller on a server the same way you could with a controller on a client. Action-based frameworks are based around these transactions, and gain great performance from that basis. Unfortunately, we had to retire our JSF application soon after it was moved to production. We just couldn't get it to scale. Ironically, it took a move to a rich-client to realize the scaling power of a transactions-based system."
