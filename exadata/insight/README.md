#Oracle Exadata Real-Time Insight

Commencing with Oracle Exadata System Software 22.1, you can use the _Oracle Exadata Real-Time Insight_ feature to enable real-time monitoring of your Exadata systems.

Real-time insight provides infrastructure to:

- **Categorize** specific metrics as fine-grained, and enable the collection of fine-grained metrics as often as every second

- **Stream** fine-grained metric observations to user-defined locations in real-time, using either push (upload) or pull (download) transmission models

- **Integrate** Exadata metrics with popular observability platforms, time-series databases, and visualization applications
