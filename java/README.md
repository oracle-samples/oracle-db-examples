# Java based examples
This is a repository of sample code that will demonstrate various concepts to assist Java developers in designing applications for accessing and processing data in the Oracle Database, leveraging Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), Universal Connection Pool (UCP); or running Java code directly in the database leveraging the embedded JVM (a.k.a. OJVM). 
We have just added the AoJ sub-repository for the Asynchronous Java Database Access (ADBA) over JDBC.

## JDBC 
Has the basic examples for JDBC and the Universal Connection Pool (UCP) code samples.
## OJVM
Has code samples for running Java in the database foreground process for in-place processing using the embedded JVM. 

## HRWebApp
A complete end to end MVC application.

## AoJ
Has code samples for learning the Asynchronous Database Access over vanilla/synchronous JDBC. This is for functional testing only.
