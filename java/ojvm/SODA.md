# SODA for Java in the Database (OJVM)

[SODA for Java](https://github.com/oracle/soda-for-java) is Oracle's fluent Java API for accessing JSON collections and documents without any knowledge of SQL.
See [Getting started with SODA for Java](https://github.com/oracle/soda-for-java/blob/master/doc/Getting-started-example.md) for more details on running testSODA.java with a client JVM (JDK or JRE).
The goal of this write up is to furnish the steps for running testSODA.java in OJVM and manipulate the JSON collection directly in the database session without moving data around.

**Requirements to run SODA with Java in the database**

(i) Download the [latest orajsoda.jar](https://github.com/oracle/soda-for-java/releases) currently orajsoda-1.0.4.jar 

(ii) Load the [latest javax.json-1.0.4.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.glassfish/javax.json/1.0.4) 

            loadjava -r -v -u hr/hr javax.json-1.0.4.jar
            
(iii) Upload orasoda.jar in your database schema

            loadjava -r -v -u hr/hr orajsoda-1.0.5.jar

**Prep testSODA.java for OJVM**

(i) Get (copy/paste) testSODA.java from [Getting started with SODA for Java](https://github.com/oracle/soda-for-java/blob/master/doc/Getting-started-example.md)

(ii) Replace the URL in the connect string with the OJVM server-side connect URL

    Replace "jdbc:oracle:thin:@//hostName:port/serviceName"
    With "jdbc:default:connection"
    
The furnished testSODA.java on this page already has the change     

(iii) load the updated testSODA.java in your  schema using

            loadjava -r -v -user hr/hr testSODA.java

(iv) Create a SQL wrapper for invoking the main method

            create or replace procedure testSODA as
            language java name 'testSODA.main(java.lang.String[])';        

(v) Invoke the wrapper of the main method and display the output

            set serveroutput on
            call dbms_java.set_output(2000);
            call testSODA();

The furnished testSODA.sql performs the steps (iv) and (v).   

From a database SQLPLUS session, issue the following call

 sqlplus hr/hr @testSODA.sql
 
 You should see the following output
 
     * Retrieving the first document by its key *

    { "name" : "Alex", "friends" : "50" }

    * Retrieving documents representing users with at least 300 friends *

    { "name" : "Mia", "friends" : "300" }
    { "name" : "Gloria", "friends" : "399" }
