   DESCRIPTION
    The sample code shows how Java applications can connect to the Oracle 
    Database using Database Resident Connection Pool (DRCP) as the server 
    side connection pool which can be shared across multiple middle tiers 
    or clients. DRCP pools database server processes and sessions (the 
    combination is known as a "pooled server").  A Connection Broker manages
    the "pooled servers" in the database instance. Upon a request from
    the client, the connection broker picks the appropriate "pooled server" and
    hands-off the client to that pooled server. The client directly
    communicates with the "pooled server" for all its database activity.  
    The "pooled server" is handed back to the connection broker when the 
    client releases it. 
    
    DRCP can be used with any third party client-side connection pool such as 
    DBCP, C3PO, etc. Third party client side connection pools must attach and
    detach connections explicitly to the connection broker through 
    attachServerConnection() and detachServerConnection(). They should also 
    set Connection Class as shown in the sample.   
    
    Use-case for DRCP: DRCP should be used in applications when multiple middle
    tiers are connected to the same database, DRCP allows you to share 
    server-side resources between the middle-tier's independent connection
    pools. For more details on DRCP refer to JDBC Developer's guide
    (https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/JJDBC/toc.htm)
    
 
  PRE-REQUISITE: DRCP should be configured at the server side before using DRCP.
  Refer to JDBC Developers Reference Guide for more details. The sample DRCP URL
  shown below refers to the client side configuration of DRCP. 

  Step 1: Enter the Database details in this file. 
          DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD and DRCP_URL are required.
          A Sample DRCP URL is shown below. (server=POOLED) identifies 
          that DRCP is enabled on the server side.           
          DRCP_URL = jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS_LIST=
          (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=proddbcluster)(PORT=5521)))
          (CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=proddb)(server=POOLED)))          
  Step 2: Run the sample with "ant DRCPSample"
