# Basic Samples in JDBC 

"Basic Samples" is the first set of code samples aimed to showcase some 
of the basic operations and using some datatypes (LOB, SQLXML, DATE etc.,)
The samples also contain Universal Connection Pool (UCP) functionalities to show
how to harvest connections, label connections, how to use different timeouts, and
how to configure MBean to monitor UCP statistics etc., 

# Creating DB User and Sample Data 
Before you run the code samples, we want you to create a new DB user and the necessary tables. 

Download [SQLDeveloper](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/sqldev-downloads-42-3802334.html) or you can use SQLPLUS. Connect to your database and login as SYSADMIN. 
Execute the script [JDBCSampleData.sql](https://github.com/oracle/oracle-db-examples/blob/basicsamples/java/jdbc/BasicSamples/JDBCSampleData.sql) that will create the new database user (jdbcuser) and the 
tables necessary for the code samples. 

# Running Code Samples 

(a) Download the [latest 12.2.0.1 ojdbc8.jar and ucp.jar](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/jdbc-ucp-122-3110062.html) and add these jars to the classpath. 

(b) Run each sample by passing the database URL and database user as the command-line 
options. The password is read from console or standard input.  

```java UCPMultiUsers -l <url> -u <user>```
  
(b) Optionally, each sample has DEFAULT_URL, DEFAULT_USER, and DEFAULT_PASSWORD 
in the file. You can choose to update these values with your database credentials
and run the program. If you don't update the defaults, then the program proceeds with the defaults
but, will hit error when connecting as these are dummy values.

```java UCPMultiUsers```
