# query_strings_as_bytes_async.py
#
# An asynchronous version of query_strings_as_bytes.py
#
# Demonstrates how to query strings as bytes (bypassing decoding of the bytes
# into a Python string). This can be useful when attempting to fetch data that
# was stored in the database in the wrong encoding.
