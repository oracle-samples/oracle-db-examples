# return_numbers_as_decimals_async.py
#
# An asynchronous version of return_numbers_as_decimals.py
#
# Returns all numbers as decimals. This is needed if the full decimal
# precision of Oracle numbers is required by the application. See this article
# (http://blog.reverberate.org/2016/02/06/floating-point-demystified-part2.html)
# for an explanation of why decimal numbers (like Oracle numbers) cannot be
# represented exactly by floating point numbers.
