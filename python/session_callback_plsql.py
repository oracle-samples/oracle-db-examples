# session_callback_plsql.py
#
# Demonstrates how to use a connection pool session callback written in
# PL/SQL. The callback is invoked whenever the tag requested by the application
# does not match the tag associated with the session in the pool. It should be
# used to set session state, so that the application can count on known session
# state, which allows the application to reduce the number of round trips to the
# database.
#
# The primary advantage to this approach over the equivalent approach shown in
# session_callback.py is when DRCP is used, as the callback is invoked on the
# server and no round trip is required to set state.
#
# Also see session_callback.py
