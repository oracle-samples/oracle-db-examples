# JSON Relational Duality

JSON Relational Duality is a landmark capability in [Oracle Database 23ai Free]( https://blogs.oracle.com/database/post/oracle-database-23c-free?source=:so:tw:or:awr:odb:::RC_WWMK220913P00038:) that provides game-changing flexibility and simplicity for Oracle Database developers. This breakthrough innovation overcomes the historical challenges that developers have faced when building applications, either when using the relational model or when using the document model.  
JSON Relational Duality delivers a solution that provides the benefits of both relational tables and JSON documents. With Duality View, while data gets stored in relational tables in a normalized way, it can be exposed to apps as JSON documents. Storing the data in relational tables delivers all the benefits of the relational model, whereas by exposing the same data as JSON documents, apps get schema flexibility and other benefits of the document model.
