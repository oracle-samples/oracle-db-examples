 * NAME
 *   dbconfig.js
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *   Holds the credentials used by node-oracledb examples to connect to the
 *   database. Production applications should consider using External
 *   Authentication to avoid hard coded credentials.
 *
 *   To create a database user, see
 *   https://blogs.oracle.com/sql/post/how-to-create-users-grant-them-privileges-and-remove-them-in-oracle-database
 *
 *   Applications can set the connectString value to an Easy Connect string,
 *   or a Net Service Name from the tnsnames.ora file or an external naming
 *   service, or it can be the name of a local Oracle Database instance.
 *
 *   If node-oracledb is linked with Instant Client, then an Easy
 *   Connect string is generally appropriate.  The basic syntax is:
 *
 *     [//]host_name[:port][/service_name][:server_type][/instance_name]
 *
 *   Commonly just the host_name and service_name are needed
 *   e.g. "localhost/orclpdb1" or "example.com/XEPDB1"
 *
 *   The Easy Connect syntax supports lots of options. To know more, please
 *   refer to the latest Oracle documentation on Easy Connect syntax:
 *   https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-B0437826-43C1-49EC-A94D-B650B6A4A6EE
 *
 *   If using a tnsnames.ora file, the file can be in a default location such
 *   as $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora or /etc/tnsnames.ora.
 *   Alternatively set the TNS_ADMIN environment variable and put the file in
 *   $TNS_ADMIN/tnsnames.ora.
 *
 *   If connectString is not specified, the empty string "" is used which
 *   indicates to connect to the local, default database.
 *
 *   External Authentication can be used by setting the optional property
 *   externalAuth to true. External Authentication allows applications to use
 *   an external password store such as Oracle Wallet, so that passwords
 *   do not need to be hard coded into the application. The user and password
 *   application. The user and password properties for connecting or creating
 *   a pool should not be set when externalAuth is true.
 *
 * TROUBLESHOOTING
 *   Refer to the Error Handling section in node-oracledb documentation
 *   to understand the different types of errors in both the Thin and Thick
 *   modes of node-oracledb:
 *   https://node-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/exception_handling.html#errors-in-thin-and-thick-modes
