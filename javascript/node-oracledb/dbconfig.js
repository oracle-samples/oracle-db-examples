 * NAME
 *   dbconfig.js
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *   Holds the credentials used by node-oracledb examples to connect
 *   to the database.  Production applications should consider using
 *   External Authentication to avoid hard coded credentials.
 *
 *   To create a database user see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDJacg0NuLo
 *
 *   Applications can set the connectString value to an Easy Connect
 *   string, or a Net Service Name from a tnsnames.ora file or
 *   external naming service, or it can be the name of a local Oracle
 *   database instance.
 *
 *   If node-oracledb is linked with Instant Client, then an Easy
 *   Connect string is generally appropriate.  The basic syntax is:
 *
 *     [//]host_name[:port][/service_name][:server_type][/instance_name]
 *
 *   Commonly just the host_name and service_name are needed
 *   e.g. "localhost/orclpdb1" or "example.com/XEPDB1"
 *
 *   The Easy Connect syntax was enhanced in Oracle Database 19c to
 *   allow more options, refer to the documentation:
 *   https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-B0437826-43C1-49EC-A94D-B650B6A4A6EE
 *
 *   If using a tnsnames.ora file, the file can be in a default
 *   location such as $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora or
 *   /etc/tnsnames.ora.  Alternatively set the TNS_ADMIN environment
 *   variable and put the file in $TNS_ADMIN/tnsnames.ora.
 *
 *   If connectString is not specified, the empty string "" is used
 *   which indicates to connect to the local, default database.
 *
 *   External Authentication can be used by setting the optional
 *   property externalAuth to true.  External Authentication allows
 *   applications to use an external password store such as Oracle
 *   Wallet so passwords do not need to be hard coded into the
 *   application.  The user and password properties for connecting or
 *   creating a pool should not be set when externalAuth is true.
 *
 * TROUBLESHOOTING
 *   Errors like:
 *     ORA-12541: TNS:no listener
 *   or
 *     ORA-12154: TNS:could not resolve the connect identifier specified
 *   indicate connectString is invalid.
 *
 *   The error:
 *     ORA-12514: TNS:listener does not currently know of requested in connect descriptor
 *   indicates connectString is invalid.  You are reaching a computer
 *   with Oracle installed but the service name isn't known.
 *   Use 'lsnrctl services' on the database server to find available services
